    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will be looking at a phenomenon of \"natural languages\" (i.e., human languages, such as English). As it turns out, when we look at the distribution of words in a different human languages, the distribution roughly follows what's called *Zipf's law* ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law)).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Zipf's law* states that given a large sample of words used, any word's frequency is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table (the word with rank 1 is the most frequently occurring word, the word with rank 2 is the second most frequently occurring word, etc). In this problem, you are going to test Zipf's law on a real dataset and explore some of its properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem assumes you have already installed the `spaCy` package ([https://spacy.io](https://spacy.io)). Instructions for installing this are part of the tutorial file \"`Anaconda, Jupyter, and spaCy setup tutorial.pdf`\". You can find how to access lemmatized tokens using `spaCy` by looking at the `spaCy` demo Jupyter notebook from lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For this problem, you don't actually need `spaCy`'s named entity recognition, grammatical parsing, or part-of-speech tagging. Turning these elements off when you instantiate the nlp object can substantially speed up your code.  To make sure these are off when instantiating the nlp object, call: \n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset is a collection of the 100 most popular books downloaded from Gutenburg Project ([https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top](https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top)). Each file contains the text of a book. Now read all the texts from disk. This will be the corpus in this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Please DO NOT change the folder name or the path, and make sure you use a relative path (e.g. './HW1_Dataset/*filename*) when reading the files. When grading your homework, we will put your Jupyter notebook file and the dataset in the same folder, and run your code. **You will receive 0 points for this problem if your code fails to load the data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: To list all files that match a certain pattern, you can use the `glob` package. Here's an example usage:\n",

    "import glob\n",
    "print(glob.glob('./HW1_Dataset/*.txt'))\n",
    "`\n",

    "Hint: When debugging your code, you may want to first make sure your code runs on a few of the books rather than all 100 (for example, you can start by only having 3 of the text files in `HW1_Dataset`). Once you're confident that your solution is correct on a few text files, then run on all of them! This is a standard approach to debugging code that is meant to handle large datasets."

       "\n",

       "longer existed in him, which had accompanied him throughout his youth\n",
       "and used to be a part of him: the wish to have teachers and to listen to\n",

       "Siddhartha learned something new on every step of his path, for the\n",
       "world was transformed, and his heart was enchanted.  He saw the sun\n",
       "rising over the mountains with their forests and setting over the\n",
       "distant beach with its palm-trees.  At night, he saw the stars in the\n",
       "sky in their fixed positions and the crescent of the moon floating like\n",
       "a boat in the blue.  He saw trees, stars, animals, clouds, rainbows,\n",
       "rocks, herbs, flowers, stream and river, the glistening dew in the\n",
       "bushes in the morning, distant high mountains which were blue and\n",
       "pale, birds sang and bees, wind silverishly blew through the rice-field.\n",
       "All of this, a thousand-fold and colourful, had always been there,\n",
       "always the sun and the moon had shone, always rivers had roared and\n",
       "bees had buzzed, but in former times all of this had been nothing more\n",
       "to Siddhartha than a fleeting, deceptive veil before his eyes,\n",
       "looked upon in distrust, destined to be penetrated and destroyed by\n",
       "thought, since it was not the essential existence, since this essence\n",
       "lay beyond, on the other side of, the visible.  But now, his liberated\n",
       "eyes stayed on this side, he saw and became aware of the visible, sought\n",
       "to be at home in this world, did not search for the true essence, did\n",
       "not aim at a world beyond.  Beautiful was this world, looking at it thus,\n",
       "without searching, thus simply, thus childlike.  Beautiful were the moon\n",
       "and the stars, beautiful was the stream and the banks, the forest and\n",
       "the rocks, the goat and the gold-beetle, the flower and the butterfly.\n",
       "Beautiful and lovely it was, thus to walk through the world, thus\n",
       "childlike, thus awoken, thus open to what is near, thus without\n",
       "distrust.  Differently the sun burnt the head, differently the shade\n",
       "of the forest cooled him down, differently the stream and the cistern,\n",
       "the pumpkin and the banana tasted.  Short were the days, short the\n",
       "nights, every hour sped swiftly away like a sail on the sea, and under\n",
       "the sail was a ship full of treasures, full of joy.  Siddhartha saw a\n",
       "group of apes moving through the high canopy of the forest, high in the\n",
       "branches, and heard their savage, greedy song.  Siddhartha saw a male\n",
       "sheep following a female one and mating with her.  In a lake of reeds,\n",
       "he saw the pike hungrily hunting for its dinner; propelling themselves\n",
       "away from it, in fear, wiggling and sparkling, the young fish jumped in\n",
       "droves out of the water; the scent of strength and passion came\n",
       "forcefully out of the hasty eddies of the water, which the pike stirred\n",
       "up, impetuously hunting.\n",
       "\n",
       "All of this had always existed, and he had not seen it; he had not been\n",
       "with it.  Now he was with it, he was part of it.  Light and shadow\n",
       "ran through his eyes, stars and moon ran through his heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the way, Siddhartha also remembered everything he had experienced in\n",
       "the Garden Jetavana, the teaching he had heard there, the divine Buddha,\n",
       "the farewell from Govinda, the conversation with the exalted one.  Again\n",
       "he remembered his own words, he had spoken to the exalted one, every\n",
       "word, and with astonishment he became aware of the fact that there he\n",
       "had said things which he had not really known yet at this time.  What he\n",
       "had said to Gotama: his, the Buddha's, treasure and secret was not the\n",
       "teachings, but the unexpressable and not teachable, which he had\n",
       "experienced in the hour of his enlightenment--it was nothing but this\n",
       "very thing which he had now gone to experience, what he now began to\n",
       "experience.  Now, he had to experience his self.  It is true that he had\n",
       "already known for a long time that his self was Atman, in its essence\n",
       "bearing the same eternal characteristics as Brahman.  But never, he had\n",
       "really found this self, because he had wanted to capture it in the net\n",
       "of thought.  With the body definitely not being the self, and not the\n",
       "spectacle of the senses, so it also was not the thought, not the\n",
       "rational mind, not the learned wisdom, not the learned ability to draw\n",
       "conclusions and to develop previous thoughts in to new ones.  No, this\n",
       "world of thought was also still on this side, and nothing could be\n",
       "achieved by killing the random self of the senses, if the random self of\n",
       "thoughts and learned knowledge was fattened on the other hand.  Both,\n",
       "the thoughts as well as the senses, were pretty things, the ultimate\n",
       "meaning was hidden behind both of them, both had to be listened to, both\n",
       "had to be played with, both neither had to be scorned nor overestimated,\n",
       "from both the secret voices of the innermost truth had to be attentively\n",
       "perceived.  He wanted to strive for nothing, except for what the voice\n",
       "commanded him to strive for, dwell on nothing, except where the voice\n",
       "would advise him to do so.  Why had Gotama, at that time, in the hour\n",
       "of all hours, sat down under the bo-tree, where the enlightenment hit\n",
       "him?  He had heard a voice, a voice in his own heart, which had\n",
       "commanded him to seek rest under this tree, and he had neither preferred\n",
       "self-castigation, offerings, ablutions, nor prayer, neither food nor\n",
       "drink, neither sleep nor dream, he had obeyed the voice.  To obey like\n",
       "this, not to an external command, only to the voice, to be ready like\n",
       "this, this was good, this was necessary, nothing else was necessary.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the night when he slept in the straw hut of a ferryman by the river,\n",
       "Siddhartha had a dream:  Govinda was standing in front of him, dressed\n",
       "in the yellow robe of an ascetic.  Sad was how Govinda looked like,\n",
       "sadly he asked:  Why have you forsaken me?  At this, he embraced\n",
       "Govinda, wrapped his arms around him, and as he was pulling him close\n",
       "to his chest and kissed him, it was not Govinda any more, but a woman,\n",
       "and a full breast popped out of the woman's dress, at which Siddhartha\n",
       "lay and drank, sweetly and strongly tasted the milk from this breast.\n",
       "It tasted of woman and man, of sun and forest, of animal and flower,\n",
       "of every fruit, of every joyful desire.  It intoxicated him and rendered\n",
       "him unconscious.--When Siddhartha woke up, the pale river shimmered\n",
       "through the door of the hut, and in the forest, a dark call of an owl\n",
       "resounded deeply and pleasantly.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the day began, Siddhartha asked his host, the ferryman, to get him\n",
       "across the river.  The ferryman got him across the river on his\n",
       "bamboo-raft, the wide water shimmered reddishly in the light of the\n",
       "morning.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This is a beautiful river,\" he said to his companion.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes,\" said the ferryman, \"a very beautiful river, I love it more than\n",
       "anything.  Often I have listened to it, often I have looked into its\n",
       "eyes, and always I have learned from it.  Much can be learned from a\n",
       "river.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I thank you, my benefactor,\" spoke Siddhartha, disembarking on the other\n",
       "side of the river.  \"I have no gift I could give you for your\n",
       "hospitality, my dear, and also no payment for your work.  I am a man\n",
       "without a home, a son of a Brahman and a Samana.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I did see it,\" spoke the ferryman, \"and I haven't expected any payment\n",
       "from you and no gift which would be the custom for guests to bear.  You\n",
       "will give me the gift another time.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you think so?\" asked Siddhartha amusedly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Surely.  This too, I have learned from the river: everything is coming\n",
       "back!  You too, Samana, will come back.  Now farewell!  Let your\n",
       "friendship be my reward.  Commemorate me, when you'll make offerings to\n",
       "the gods.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Smiling, they parted.  Smiling, Siddhartha was happy about the\n",
       "friendship and the kindness of the ferryman.  \"He is like Govinda,\" he\n",
       "thought with a smile, \"all I meet on my path are like Govinda.  All are\n",
       "thankful, though they are the ones who would have a right to receive\n",
       "thanks.  All are submissive, all would like to be friends, like to\n",
       "obey, think little.  Like children are all people.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "At about noon, he came through a village.  In front of the mud cottages,\n",
       "children were rolling about in the street, were playing with\n",
       "pumpkin-seeds and sea-shells, screamed and wrestled, but they all\n",
       "timidly fled from the unknown Samana.  In the end of the village, the\n",
       "path led through a stream, and by the side of the stream, a young\n",
       "woman was kneeling and washing clothes.  When Siddhartha greeted her,\n",
       "she lifted her head and looked up to him with a smile, so that he saw\n",
       "the white in her eyes glistening.  He called out a blessing to her, as\n",
       "it is the custom among travellers, and asked how far he still had to go\n",
       "to reach the large city.  Then she got up and came to him, beautifully\n",
       "her wet mouth was shimmering in her young face.  She exchanged humorous\n",
       "banter with him, asked whether he had eaten already, and whether it was\n",
       "true that the Samanas slept alone in the forest at night and were not\n",
       "allowed to have any women with them.  While talking, she put her left\n",
       "foot on his right one and made a movement as a woman does who would want\n",
       "to initiate that kind of sexual pleasure with a man, which the textbooks\n",
       "call \"climbing a tree\".  Siddhartha felt his blood heating up, and since\n",
       "in this moment he had to think of his dream again, he bend slightly\n",
       "down to the woman and kissed with his lips the brown nipple of her\n",
       "breast.  Looking up, he saw her face smiling full of lust and her\n",
       "eyes, with contracted pupils, begging with desire.\n",
       "\n",
       "Siddhartha also felt desire and felt the source of his sexuality moving;\n",
       "but since he had never touched a woman before, he hesitated for a\n",
       "moment, while his hands were already prepared to reach out for her.  And\n",
       "in this moment he heard, shuddering with awe, the voice if his innermost\n",
       "self, and this voice said No.  Then, all charms disappeared from the\n",
       "young woman's smiling face, he no longer saw anything else but the damp\n",
       "glance of a female animal in heat.  Politely, he petted her cheek,\n",
       "turned away from her and disappeared away from the disappointed woman\n",
       "with light steps into the bamboo-wood.\n",
       "\n",
       "On this day, he reached the large city before the evening, and was\n",
       "happy, for he felt the need to be among people.  For a long time, he\n",
       "had lived in the forests, and the straw hut of the ferryman, in which\n",
       "he had slept that night, had been the first roof for a long time he has\n",
       "had over his head.\n",
       "\n",
       "Before the city, in a beautifully fenced grove, the traveller came\n",
       "across a small group of servants, both male and female, carrying\n",
       "baskets.  In their midst, carried by four servants in an ornamental\n",
       "sedan-chair, sat a woman, the mistress, on red pillows under a colourful\n",
       "canopy.  Siddhartha stopped at the entrance to the pleasure-garden and\n",
       "watched the parade, saw the servants, the maids, the baskets, saw the\n",
       "sedan-chair and saw the lady in it.  Under black hair, which made to\n",
       "tower high on her head, he saw a very fair, very delicate, very smart\n",
       "face, a brightly red mouth, like a freshly cracked fig, eyebrows which\n",
       "were well tended and painted in a high arch, smart and watchful dark\n",
       "eyes, a clear, tall neck rising from a green and golden garment, resting\n",
       "fair hands, long and thin, with wide golden bracelets over the wrists.\n",
       "\n",
       "Siddhartha saw how beautiful she was, and his heart rejoiced.  He bowed\n",
       "deeply, when the sedan-chair came closer, and straightening up again,\n",
       "he looked at the fair, charming face, read for a moment in the smart\n",
       "eyes with the high arcs above, breathed in a slight fragrant, he did\n",
       "not know.  With a smile, the beautiful women nodded for a moment and\n",
       "disappeared into the grove, and then the servant as well.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus I am entering this city, Siddhartha thought, with a charming omen.\n",
       "He instantly felt drawn into the grove, but he thought about it, and\n",
       "only now he became aware of how the servants and maids had looked at him\n",
       "at the entrance, how despicable, how distrustful, how rejecting.\n",
       "\n",
       "I am still a Samana, he thought, I am still an ascetic and beggar.  I\n",
       "must not remain like this, I will not be able to enter the grove like\n",
       "this.  And he laughed.\n",
       "\n",
       "The next person who came along this path he asked about the grove and\n",
       "for the name of the woman, and was told that this was the grove of\n",
       "Kamala, the famous courtesan, and that, aside from the grove, she owned\n",
       "a house in the city.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then, he entered the city.  Now he had a goal.\n",
       "\n",
       "Pursuing his goal, he allowed the city to suck him in, drifted through\n",
       "the flow of the streets, stood still on the squares, rested on the\n",
       "stairs of stone by the river.  When the evening came, he made friends\n",
       "with barber's assistant, whom he had seen working in the shade of an\n",
       "arch in a building, whom he found again praying in a temple of Vishnu,\n",
       "whom he told about stories of Vishnu and the Lakshmi.  Among the boats\n",
       "by the river, he slept this night, and early in the morning, before the\n",
       "first customers came into his shop, he had the barber's assistant shave\n",
       "his beard and cut his hair, comb his hair and anoint it with fine oil.\n",
       "Then he went to take his bath in the river.\n",
       "\n",
       "When late in the afternoon, beautiful Kamala approached her grove in her\n",
       "sedan-chair, Siddhartha was standing at the entrance, made a bow and\n",
       "received the courtesan's greeting.  But that servant who walked at the\n",
       "very end of her train he motioned to him and asked him to inform his\n",
       "mistress that a young Brahman would wish to talk to her.  After a while,\n",
       "the servant returned, asked him, who had been waiting, to follow him\n",
       "conducted him, who was following him, without a word into a pavilion,\n",
       "where Kamala was lying on a couch, and left him alone with her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Weren't you already standing out there yesterday, greeting me?\" asked\n",
       "Kamala.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It's true that I've already seen and greeted you yesterday.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But didn't you yesterday wear a beard, and long hair, and dust in your\n",
       "hair?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have observed well, you have seen everything.  You have seen\n",
       "Siddhartha, the son of a Brahman, who has left his home to become a\n",
       "Samana, and who has been a Samana for three years.  But now, I have\n",
       "left that path and came into this city, and the first one I met, even\n",
       "before I had entered the city, was you.  To say this, I have come to\n",
       "you, oh Kamala!  You are the first woman whom Siddhartha is not\n",
       "addressing with his eyes turned to the ground.  Never again I want to\n",
       "turn my eyes to the ground, when I'm coming across a beautiful woman.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Kamala smiled and played with her fan of peacocks' feathers.  And asked:\n",
       "\"And only to tell me this, Siddhartha has come to me?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To tell you this and to thank you for being so beautiful.  And if it\n",
       "doesn't displease you, Kamala, I would like to ask you to be my friend\n",
       "and teacher, for I know nothing yet of that art which you have mastered\n",
       "in the highest degree.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "At this, Kamala laughed aloud.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Never before this has happened to me, my friend, that a Samana from the\n",
       "forest came to me and wanted to learn from me!  Never before this has\n",
       "happened to me, that a Samana came to me with long hair and an old, torn\n",
       "loin-cloth!  Many young men come to me, and there are also sons of\n",
       "Brahmans among them, but they come in beautiful clothes, they come in\n",
       "fine shoes, they have perfume in their hair and money in their pouches.\n",
       "This is, oh Samana, how the young men are like who come to me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Quoth Siddhartha:  \"Already I am starting to learn from you.  Even\n",
       "yesterday, I was already learning.  I have already taken off my beard,\n",
       "have combed the hair, have oil in my hair.  There is little which is\n",
       "still missing in me, oh excellent one: fine clothes, fine shoes, money\n",
       "in my pouch.  You shall know, Siddhartha has set harder goals for\n",
       "himself than such trifles, and he has reached them.  How shouldn't I\n",
       "reach that goal, which I have set for myself yesterday:  to be your\n",
       "friend and to learn the joys of love from you!  You'll see that I'll\n",
       "learn quickly, Kamala, I have already learned harder things than what\n",

       "satisfied with Siddhartha as he is, with oil in his hair, but without\n",
       "clothes, without shoes, without money?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Laughing, Kamala exclaimed:  \"No, my dear, he doesn't satisfy me yet.\n",

       "and lots of money in his pouch, and gifts for Kamala.  Do you know it\n",
       "now, Samana from the forest?  Did you mark my words?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, I have marked your words,\" Siddhartha exclaimed.  \"How should I\n",
       "not mark words which are coming from such a mouth!  Your mouth is like\n",
       "a freshly cracked fig, Kamala.  My mouth is red and fresh as well, it\n",
       "will be a suitable match for yours, you'll see.--But tell me, beautiful\n",
       "Kamala, aren't you at all afraid of the Samana from the forest, who has\n",
       "come to learn how to make love?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Whatever for should I be afraid of a Samana, a stupid Samana from the\n",

       "women are?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, he's strong, the Samana, and he isn't afraid of anything.  He could\n",

       "\"No, Samana, I am not afraid of this.  Did any Samana or Brahman ever\n",
       "fear, someone might come and grab him and steal his learning, and his\n",
       "religious devotion, and his depth of thought?  No, for they are his very\n",
       "own, and he would only give away from those whatever he is willing to\n",
       "give and to whomever he is willing to give.  Like this it is, precisely\n",
       "like this it is also with Kamala and with the pleasures of love.\n",
       "Beautiful and red is Kamala's mouth, but just try to kiss it against\n",
       "Kamala's will, and you will not obtain a single drop of sweetness from\n",
       "it, which knows how to give so many sweet things!  You are learning\n",
       "easily, Siddhartha, thus you should also learn this: love can be\n",
       "obtained by begging, buying, receiving it as a gift, finding it in the\n",
       "street, but it cannot be stolen.  In this, you have come up with the\n",
       "wrong path.  No, it would be a pity, if a pretty young man like you\n",
       "would want to tackle it in such a wrong manner.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Siddhartha bowed with a smile.  \"It would be a pity, Kamala, you are so\n",

       "Siddhartha will return, once he'll have what he still lacks:\n",

       "\n",
       "\"An advice?  Why not?  Who wouldn't like to give an advice to a poor,\n",

       "possible to be carried by it, miracles can be performed with it, but it\n",
       "cannot be expressed in words and taught.  This was what I, even as a\n",

       "and truth, into suffering and salvation.  It cannot be done differently,\n",
       "there is no other way for him who wants to teach.  But the world itself,\n",

       "entirely holy or entirely sinful.  It does really seem like this,\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Once upon a time there might have been seen a gentle Knight, riding\n",
       "across the plain. He was clad in armour of proof, and on his arm he\n",
       "carried a silver shield. A shield it was that brave men had carried\n",
       "before him, for there were great dints upon it, which were as a witness\n",
       "of great fights that had been fought. Now the Knight himself had never\n",
       "yet been in battle; but he seemed as one who could bear himself bravely,\n",
       "so well did he sit upon his horse, and so stout of limb he was. On his\n",
       "breast he wore a cross, red as blood, in token that he was vowed to\n",
       "serve the Lord Christ, who had died for him; and on his shield was yet\n",
       "another cross, to be as it were a sign that this service should be a\n",
       "defence to him in all dangers. Somewhat sad of look he was, not as\n",
       "though he had fear in his heart, but rather as one upon whom had been\n",
       "laid the burden of a great task. And such, in truth, there was, for\n",
       "Queen Gloriana had sent him upon a great enterprise, and all his heart\n",
       "was full of the thought of how he should best accomplish it. And the\n",
       "task was this—to slay the Great Dragon.\n",
       "\n",
       "Beside the Knight a lady was riding on an ass as white as snow. Very\n",
       "fair she was; but she hid her fairness under a veil, which was brought\n",
       "low over her face. She was clad also in a garment of black; and she,\n",
       "too, was somewhat sad of look, nor, indeed, without cause. She came of a\n",
       "royal stock, being descended from ancient kings and queens, who had held\n",
       "wide sway in their land until this same Dragon had driven out their\n",
       "ancient house and had cruelly wasted all their realm. The third of this\n",
       "company was a Dwarf, who lagged behind, wearied, it may be, with the\n",
       "weight of the bag in which he bore this fair lady’s gear.\n",
       "\n",
       "While the three, to wit the Knight, and the Lady, and the Dwarf, passed\n",
       "on, the sky was suddenly covered with clouds, and there began to fall a\n",
       "great storm of rain, so that they were fain to seek some shelter.\n",
       "Gladly, then, did they espy a wood hard by that promised, so thickly\n",
       "grown it was, a shelter from the rain. Tall were the trees and spreading\n",
       "wide with shady branches, so that neither sun by day nor star by night\n",
       "could pierce through. And all about were paths and ways, worn as by the\n",
       "treading of many feet, which seemed to lead to the abodes of men—a\n",
       "fairer place of shelter, as it seemed, there scarce could be. So they\n",
       "passed along, the birds singing sweetly the while; overhead were trees\n",
       "of many kinds, trees of the forest and of the orchard, the cedar and the\n",
       "oak, and the elm with the vine clinging to its stem, the yew for bows,\n",
       "and the birch for arrows, and the fruitful olive. So fair was the place,\n",
       "and so full of delights, that the travellers took no heed of the way by\n",
       "which they went. So it came to pass that they strayed from the path by\n",
       "which they first entered the wood, nor could they win to it again when\n",
       "once they had left it, so many were the ways and so like the one to the\n",
       "other. After a time, when they had taken counsel together, it seemed\n",
       "best to choose the way which seemed most trodden by the feet of\n",
       "travellers, as being the likeliest to lead to a certain end. When they\n",
       "had followed this awhile, they came to a great cave, deep in the very\n",
       "thicket of the wood. Here the Knight sprang from his horse, and gave to\n",
       "the Dwarf his spear, thinking that he should not need it. But his sword\n",
       "he kept.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said the Lady Una, for that was her name: “Be not overbold, Sir\n",
       "Knight; there may be mischief here of which you know nothing, peril\n",
       "which gives no sign of itself, even as a fire which burns without smoke;\n",
       "hold back, I pray you, till you have made some trial of the place.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The Knight made reply: “Fair lady, it were a shame to fall back for fear\n",
       "of a shadow. The cave, doubtless, is dark, but where there is courage\n",
       "there is not wanting a light for the feet.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said the Lady again: “Nay, nay, Sir Knight; I know this place by\n",
       "repute, though I thought not of it before. This wood in which we are\n",
       "lost is the Wood of Wandering; this cave which you see before you is the\n",
       "Den of Error, a monster, hateful both to God and man. Beware, therefore,\n",
       "beware!” And the Dwarf cried out aloud in his fear: “Fly, Sir Knight,\n",
       "fly, this is no place for mortal man.”\n",
       "\n",
       "But the Knight would not be persuaded. He stepped into the cave, and the\n",
       "light of day, shining from without on his armour, showed him dimly the\n",
       "monster that was within. Hideous it was to behold, half a serpent and\n",
       "half a woman, and all as foul as ever creature was, upon the earth or\n",
       "under it. All the length of the cave she lay, her tail wound in many\n",
       "coils; and in every coil there was a deadly sting. And all round her was\n",
       "a brood of young ones. Many different shapes they had, but hideous all.\n",
       "And as soon as the light from the Knight’s armour glimmered through the\n",
       "darkness, they fled for shelter to the mouth of their dam.\n",
       "\n",
       "The monster, wakened from her sleep, curled her tail about her head, and\n",
       "rushed to the cavern’s mouth, but, seeing one armed from top to toe in\n",
       "shining mail, would have turned again. But the Knight leaped at her,\n",
       "fierce as a lion leaps upon his prey, and barred her backward way with\n",
       "his sword. First she darted at him her great tail, and threatened him\n",
       "with the deadly sting that lay in it; but he, not one whit dismayed,\n",
       "aimed at her head a mighty blow. Her head it wounded not, but glanced on\n",
       "to the neck with force so great that for a while the great beast was\n",
       "stunned. Then, coming to herself, she raised her body high from the\n",
       "ground, and leaped upon the Knight’s shield, and wrapped his body round\n",
       "with huge folds.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Una, seeing in how sore plight he was, cried out: “Now show, Sir\n",
       "Knight, what you are. Put out all your force, and, above all things,\n",
       "back your force with faith, and be not faint. Strangle this monster, or\n",
       "surely she will strangle you!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Greatly was his heart stirred within him with grief and anger, and,\n",
       "knitting all his strength together, he gripped the creature by the\n",
       "throat so mightily that she was constrained to loosen the bonds which\n",
       "she had cast about him. And yet, it had well-nigh cost him dear to come\n",
       "so close to the monster, so foul she was. And of this foulness the worst\n",
       "was this, that she caused to come forth out of her mouth, as in a flood,\n",
       "the brood which had taken shelter therein at the first. Serpents they\n",
       "were, like to their dam, small indeed, but full of venom, and they\n",
       "swarmed over him, twining themselves about his arms and legs, so that he\n",
       "could not strike a blow nor even move. So, in some still eventide, a\n",
       "shepherd, sitting to watch his flock, is suddenly assailed by a cloud of\n",
       "gnats; feeble creatures they are, and slight their sting, but they\n",
       "suffer him not to rest. The Red-Cross Knight was in a strait more dire,\n",
       "for these evil creatures had power to do him a more grievous harm. But\n",
       "he thought to himself, “Shall I be vanquished in this fashion?” He was\n",
       "somewhat moved by the danger wherein he stood, but more ashamed that he\n",
       "should be overcome in so foul a fashion. So, resolved in his heart that\n",
       "he would put all his strength into a stroke, either to win or to lose,\n",
       "he gathered himself together, and struck the monster with a blow so\n",
       "fierce that he shore the head from the body, and she fell dead upon the\n",
       "ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said the Lady Una: “Well, indeed, have you carried yourself, Sir\n",
       "Knight. Surely you were born under a lucky star, seeing that you have\n",
       "overcome so terrible a foe. You are worthy of these arms wherewith you\n",
       "are clad. So is your first adventure brought to a good result. God grant\n",
       "that you have many such in the time to come, and that they may be\n",
       "brought to as happy an ending.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then the Knight sprang upon his horse, and the Lady Una mounted again\n",
       "her ass, and the Dwarf followed as before. And now they kept with\n",
       "steadfast purpose to the one way which they saw to be most trodden,\n",
       "turning neither to the right nor to the left, how fair soever the path\n",
       "might seem. So at last they came to the outskirts of the Wandering Wood,\n",
       "and journeyed once more across the plain.\n",

       "So the two, the Knight and the Lady, rode on, the Dwarf following as\n",
       "before. After a while they chanced to meet an old man by the road. He\n",
       "was clothed in black and barefooted, and he had a long white beard, and\n",
       "a book was hanging from his belt. A very wise old man he seemed, sober\n",
       "and even somewhat sad, and as he went along he seemed to be praying; and\n",
       "now and again he would beat upon his breast, saying, “God be merciful to\n",
       "me a sinner!” He made a humble reverence to the Knight, and the Knight\n",
       "in his courtesy made his salute, and said: “Sir, do you know of any\n",
       "adventure that a Christian man may undertake?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“My son,” said the old man, “how should one who lives in his cell and\n",
       "tells his beads and does penance for his sins know aught of wars and\n",
       "enterprises by which glory may be won? Nevertheless, I can tell of a\n",
       "very evil man who dwells in these forests and wastes all the\n",
       "country-side.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ah!” cried the Knight, “it is for such an adventure, the setting right\n",
       "of wrong, that I seek. Bring me to this villain’s dwelling and I will\n",
       "reward you well.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Willingly,” said the old man, “will I guide you thither, but the way is\n",
       "long and painful.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“And surely,” said the Lady Una, “you are wearied with your late\n",
       "encounter. I take it that he who lacks rest lacks strength, however\n",
       "stout of limb he be. Take your rest then with the sun, and begin your\n",
       "new work with the new day.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“This is wise counsel, Sir Knight,” said the old man, “and wise counsel\n",
       "ever wins the day. The day is far spent; come, then, and take such poor\n",
       "entertainment as my home can give.”\n",
       "\n",
       "With this the Knight was well content. So they followed the old man to\n",
       "his dwelling. It was a lowly hermitage, in a valley, close to the\n",
       "forest, with a chapel hard by, and by this chapel a brook crystal clear.\n",
       "Humble was their fare, but the rest after the day’s toil made it sweet\n",
       "enough, as also did the old man’s talk, for he discoursed of many things\n",
       "and many men, saints and popes, and the great deeds which they had done.\n",
       "Then, as the night drew on and sleep began to fall upon their eyes, he\n",
       "showed them the places where they should lodge for the night.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now this old man, who seemed so pious and good, with his long white\n",
       "beard, and his prayers, and his beating of his breast, was really a\n",
       "wicked magician. So soon as he had taken his guests to their lodgings,\n",
       "he went to his study, where he kept his books of charms with other\n",
       "contrivances of his art, and taking one of these books from the shelf on\n",
       "which it stood, opened it, and began to mutter some dreadful words which\n",
       "it were a great sin for anyone to write or read. With these he brought\n",
       "up from their dwelling-place in the lower parts of the earth a very\n",
       "legion of evil spirits. To these he gave a part of his evil work to do,\n",
       "and some of this work he kept to himself; and the work was this: To\n",
       "cheat the hearts of those whom he wished to deceive with false dreams\n",
       "and visions. What these were, it is best not to tell: let it be enough\n",
       "to say that they wrought such doubts concerning the Lady Una in the\n",
       "heart of the Red-Cross Knight that, as soon as the morning dawned, he\n",
       "rose from his bed, and clothed himself with all haste, and crying for\n",
       "the Dwarf that he should bring him his horse, rode away as fast as the\n",
       "beast could carry him.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had not ridden many miles before there met him a paynim knight. A\n",
       "tall warrior and a strong he was, armed from top to toe, and carrying a\n",
       "great shield on which were written in scarlet letters the words “_Sans\n",
       "Foy_,” which, being interpreted, mean “Without Faith.” With him there\n",
       "rode a fair lady, clad also in scarlet, with ornaments of gold and\n",
       "necklaces of coral, and on her head a Persian cap set round with crowns\n",
       "of gold. Her horse also had gay trappings, and her bridle was set with\n",
       "bells of gold, which tinkled bravely as she rode. So soon as she saw the\n",
       "Red-Cross Knight she said to her companion, “See now, here comes your\n",
       "enemy; make ready.”\n",
       "\n",
       "No sooner had she spoken, but he stuck spurs in his horse, and rode at\n",
       "the Red-Cross Knight. Nor did the knight hold back from the fray, for he\n",
       "also put his spear in rest and charged. So the two met fully and fairly,\n",
       "with so fierce a shock that the two horses stood, as it were, struck to\n",
       "stone, and the riders were borne backwards in their saddles, holding\n",
       "each of them in his hand his broken spear. Then the Saracen drew his\n",
       "sword from the scabbard, and addressed himself again to the fray. So did\n",
       "the Christian also; blow for blow did they deal one to the other, till\n",
       "the sparks flew from their shields, and when they chanced to strike\n",
       "home, the blood flowed forth and dyed the earth under their feet. After\n",
       "a while cried the Saracen: “Now curse upon that Cross which keeps your\n",
       "body from harm! You had been dead long since but for that magic power.\n",
       "For all that, I bid you now beware, and keep safe your head if it may\n",
       "be.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So saying, he dealt a blow so fierce that it shore away half the\n",
       "Christian’s crest, yet glancing down upon the shield harmed him no more.\n",
       "Yet was it not struck in vain, for it roused him of the Red Cross to\n",
       "such rage that he made a more than like reply. Full on the Saracen’s\n",
       "helmet he dealt his stroke. Right through the steel it passed, and cleft\n",
       "the head, so that the Saracen fell a dead man from his horse.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the lady saw her champion fall, not a moment did she stay to see\n",
       "how it had fared with him, either to tend his wounds, or to weep for his\n",
       "death, but fled away as fast as her horse could carry her. Then the\n",
       "Red-Cross Knight, crying to the Dwarf that he should pick up the dead\n",
       "man’s shield to be a memorial of the fight, rode after her, and\n",
       "overtaking her, bade her halt: “You have no cause to fear, fair lady,”\n",

       "Then she, turning back, cried aloud: “Fair Sir, have mercy on an unhappy\n",
       "woman!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Much was he moved to see her humbleness, for she was beautiful to look\n",
       "on, and richly clad, as one of noble birth might be. “Lady,” said he,\n",
       "“be of good heart. It pitieth me to see you in such distress; tell me\n",
       "now who you are, and whence you come, and who was this your champion?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Sir,” she answered, weeping the while, “I have suffered much from evil\n",
       "fortune. I was the only daughter of an emperor, who had wide dominion\n",
       "over the land of the West, setting his throne where flows the famous\n",
       "stream of Tiber. Being such, I was betrothed in my early youth to the\n",
       "only son and heir of a most wise and mighty king. Never surely was\n",
       "prince so fair and faithful as he, never one so gentle and debonair. But\n",
       "alas! ere the day appointed for our marriage came, my lord fell into the\n",
       "hands of cruel enemies, and was most foully slain. When this ill news\n",
       "came to me, I said to myself: ‘Now will I at least do due honour to the\n",
       "dear body of him whom I loved.’ So I set forth from my father’s house\n",
       "upon this quest. Long did I wander over the world, a virgin widow, nor\n",
       "did I find that for which I sought. At last I chanced to meet this\n",
       "Saracen, who now lies dead upon the plain. He constrained me to go with\n",
       "him, and would fain have won me for his wife, but I ever said him nay.\n",
       "And now he lies dead. An evil man he was, one of an evil brotherhood of\n",
       "three—Sansloy, the eldest; Sansjoy, the youngest; and this Sansfoy, of\n",
       "middle age between the two.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Be contented, fair lady,” answered the Knight; “you have done well. You\n",
       "have found a new friend and lost an old foe. Friend, be he ever so new,\n",
       "is better, I trow, than foe, new or old.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So the two rode on, he making merry with gay talk, as became a courteous\n",
       "knight, and she, with much modest show of bashfulness. After a while\n",
       "they came in their journey to two fair trees, which spread their\n",
       "branches across the road. Lovely trees they seemed, and fair was the\n",
       "shade which they cast. Yet was the place held in ill-repute of all the\n",
       "country-side; never did shepherd sit beneath them to rest or play upon\n",
       "his oaten pipe, for all men held it to be unlucky ground. But of this\n",
       "the good Knight knew nothing, so, the sun being now high in heaven, and\n",
       "of so fierce a heat that a man might scarcely abide it, he dismounted\n",
       "and bade the lady do likewise, so that they might rest awhile, and anon,\n",
       "in the cool of the evening, might pursue their journey. So the two sat\n",
       "them down and talked.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now the Knight, being in a merry mood, said to himself: “Surely, this is\n",
       "the fairest of women; it is meet that she should be crowned.” So saying,\n",
       "he plucked a branch which he would have shaped into a garland for the\n",
       "lady’s head. Then, lo! from the place where the branch had been plucked\n",
       "came trickling drops of blood, and there issued forth a lamentable voice\n",
       "which said: “Stranger! Tear not in this cruel fashion the tender human\n",
       "limbs which are covered by the bark of this tree. Fly also from the\n",
       "place, fly, lest haply the same fate should come upon you as came upon\n",
       "me in this place, both on me and on the dear lady also who was my love.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Much was the Knight astonished to hear such words, and for a while he\n",
       "stood speechless. Then he said: “What ghost is this from the world\n",
       "below, what wandering spirit that talks in this strange fashion?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then there came this answer: “No ghost am I from the nether world, nor\n",
       "wandering spirit of the air. I was a man, Fradubio by name, as now I am\n",
       "a tree, being charmed by the arts of a wicked witch. But I am yet a man,\n",
       "for I feel the winter cold and the summer heat in these branches, even\n",
       "as a man might feel.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said the Knight: “Tell me now, Fradubio, be you tree or man, how\n",
       "you came to suffer in this fashion. It is good for a man to tell his\n",
       "trouble; he who hides it in his heart makes his griefs to be twice as\n",
       "great.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then did Fradubio tell his tale, “Know, stranger, that I suffer this\n",
       "trouble through the arts of a false sorceress, Duessa by name; nor I\n",
       "only, for she has brought many knights into a like evil case. In my\n",
       "youth, which indeed is not long passed, I loved a fair lady, whom you\n",
       "may see, not indeed in the fashion of a lady, but as yonder tree which\n",
       "joins its branches with these. Once upon a time, when I was riding\n",
       "abroad with her, I chanced to meet a knight, who also had a fair lady\n",
       "for a companion. A fair lady I called her, and so she seemed, but she\n",
       "was in truth this same false witch Duessa. Said the strange Knight: ‘I\n",
       "do declare that this lady is the fairest dame in all the world, and this\n",
       "I will make good with my sword and spear against all the world.’ For the\n",
       "witch had cast her spells over him and deceived him. And when I put\n",
       "forth the same challenge for my own lady, we fell to fighting, and he\n",
       "fared so ill, that he fell by my hand.\n",
       "\n",
       "“So now there were two fair ladies, for so it seemed, Fraelissa, who was\n",
       "fair in truth, and Duessa, who by her wicked arts had made herself so to\n",
       "seem. And I knew not to which I should give the prize of beauty, for it\n",
       "seemed the due of each. But while I doubted, this wicked witch raised by\n",
       "evil arts such a mist as made Fraelissa’s face to lose all its fairness.\n",
       "Which when she had accomplished, she cried: ‘See now how this false dame\n",
       "has lost her beauty, for indeed it was but borrowed. Many has she\n",
       "deceived in time past, even as now she has deceived you.’ When I heard\n",
       "this, I would fain have killed the fair lady that had been my true love.\n",
       "But this the false Duessa, feigning compassion, would not suffer. Only\n",
       "with her magic arts she changed her into that tree which you see yonder.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Now you must know that for every witch, be she as crafty as she may,\n",
       "there is one day in every year when she is constrained to take her true\n",
       "shape. And on this day I chanced to see Duessa as she was in truth, old\n",
       "and foul of hue, fouler than one had thought woman could be. Nor did she\n",
       "fail to perceive that I had discovered the truth, though indeed I sought\n",
       "to bear myself as before, having it in my mind secretly to escape, and\n",
       "fly from her company. So she practised upon me the same wicked arts that\n",
       "she had used with my Fraelissa, changing me into the semblance of a\n",
       "tree. And here we stand, banished from the company of men, and wasting\n",
       "weary days and nights.”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "While the Red-Cross Knight was thus faring, the Lady Una was not a\n",
       "little troubled that she should have been so left by her champion. Never\n",
       "did she cease to search for him, wandering the while over plain, and\n",
       "forest, and mountain, and not one whit afraid, however desolate they\n",
       "were.\n",
       "\n",
       "On a certain day she lighted off the ass, on which she was wont to ride,\n",
       "and laid herself down to rest in a solitary place, under the shadow of a\n",
       "tree; she took the covering from her head, and laid aside her black\n",
       "cloak; her faithful beast grazed hard by, for there was much grass in\n",
       "the place. As she lay, there rushed out of the wood with which the\n",
       "meadow was circled about a furious lion. Wild he was with hunger, and\n",
       "was hunting for prey. And when he saw the royal maid, he ran greedily at\n",
       "her with open mouth, as if he would have devoured her; but when he came\n",
       "near, and saw what manner of maid she was, all his rage departed from\n",
       "him. He kissed her weary feet, and licked with his tongue her lily\n",
       "hands, crouching down before her as if to show himself her servant. At\n",
       "the first sight of the beast the Lady Una was not a little afraid, but\n",
       "when she saw how gently he bore himself, she sighed and said: “See now,\n",
       "how this lion, who is the king of the forest, forgets his hunger and his\n",
       "rage in pity of my sad state, while he who was my champion leaves me to\n",
       "wander alone.” So she spake till she could speak no more for very tears,\n",
       "and the lion meanwhile stood looking upon her. Then—for the lady was of\n",
       "a brave spirit—she shut up her sorrows in her heart, and mounted on her\n",
       "steed again, and set out once more upon her quest. It was a long and\n",
       "weary way which she went, through divers places, where there were no\n",
       "inhabitants, and still the lion went with her, ready to guard her\n",
       "against all dangers. While she slept, he watched over her, and when she\n",
       "awaked he awaited her command, watching her eyes so that he might\n",
       "discern her pleasure.\n",
       "\n",
       "After long journeying, in which they saw no sign of the presence of man,\n",
       "they came to a place which, from the wearing of the grass, seemed to be\n",
       "trodden by human feet. And in no long time the lady espied a woman, who\n",
       "was following the path with slow steps, and carrying on her head a\n",
       "pitcher of water. The lady cried to her, “Tell me now, my friend,\n",
       "whether there may be any dwelling near to hand, where I may rest\n",
       "awhile?” But the woman answered her never a word, seeming as if she\n",
       "could neither understand nor speak. But when, turning her eyes, she saw\n",
       "the lion by the lady’s side, she threw down her pitcher, and fled as\n",
       "fast as her feet could carry her. Not once did she look behind her, but\n",
       "fled as if for her life till she came to the house where she dwelt with\n",
       "her mother, a blind woman. Not a word did she say, but her fear was\n",
       "plain to see, and the old woman perceived that there was some great\n",
       "danger at hand, so when they two had shut the door they hid themselves\n",
       "in the darkest corner of the cottage.\n",
       "\n",
       "In a short space of time came Una and her lion to the door. Thereat the\n",
       "lady knocked, but when no one answered, and the time was passing, the\n",
       "lion in his impatience rent the wicket-gate with his claws and let her\n",
       "in. No further hurt did he, and when Una had with much gentle speech\n",
       "allayed the women’s fear, they laid themselves down to sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "But when the night was far spent, there came one to the door demanding\n",
       "entrance, and when this was not speedily given him, using many oaths and\n",
       "curses. He was a sturdy thief, by name Kirkrapine, that is to say,\n",
       "Robber of Churches, and this indeed was his trade. He was wont to steal\n",
       "away the ornaments of churches, and to strip off from the images of the\n",
       "saints the vestments with which they were clad, and to purloin the robes\n",
       "of the priests, and to break open the boxes in which were put the alms\n",
       "for the poor. No small share of the plunder did he bring to the house\n",
       "where Una lay that night, for he was the lover of the old woman’s\n",
       "daughter, and he could never give her enough of gold and jewels and\n",
       "precious things. But whether the old woman knew of the matter none can\n",
       "tell, though it might have seemed that such doings were not to her mind,\n",
       "seeing that she told her beads and prayed both by day and by night; nine\n",
       "hundred Paternosters would she say daily, and of Ave Marias twice as\n",
       "many. Thrice in the week, also, did she sit in ashes; thrice three times\n",
       "she fasted from all food and drink, and she wore sackcloth nearest to\n",
       "her skin.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now when this same Kirkrapine found that, for all his cursing, he could\n",
       "not win an entrance, for, indeed, though the women heard him, they were\n",
       "hindered from rising by fear of the lion, he let fly furiously at the\n",
       "door and brake it down, and would have entered. But as he was about to\n",
       "cross the threshold, the beast, thinking that his lady was in danger,\n",
       "sprang at him, and brought him to the ground, and so tore him that he\n",
       "died, which, having done, the lion came back to his place by the lady’s\n",
       "side, and watched her as before.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the day broke, the Lady Una rose from her place, and went forth\n",
       "from the cottage, and journeyed onwards still seeking the Knight, and\n",
       "the lion went with her. The old woman also and her daughter, so soon as\n",
       "the house was clear of its guests, rose up. But when they found\n",
       "Kirkrapine lying dead before the door, great was their grief and greater\n",
       "still their anger.\n",
       "\n",
       "“This,” they cried, “the savage beast has done,” and they followed with\n",
       "all the speed they might use, and so overtook her. Harm her they might\n",
       "not, for they feared the lion, and when they had cursed her loud and\n",
       "long they turned back to go to their own house.\n",
       "\n",
       "As they went they met a knight, fully clad in armour. But yet he was no\n",
       "knight but only the wizard Archimage, who had taken upon himself, by\n",
       "help of his wicked arts, the semblance of the Red-Cross Knight. The\n",
       "false knight asked them whether they had seen a lady journeying alone.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yea,” the old woman answered, “such I have seen; an evil woman she is,\n",
       "and much harm hath she wrought.” And she told a piteous tale of the\n",
       "things which she had suffered. This done, she showed him the way by\n",
       "which he must go, if he would overtake the lady, and he, having thanked\n",
       "her with due courtesy, rode on. Nor was it long before he overtook the\n",
       "Lady Una, for she, having but an ass for her steed, travelled slowly.\n",
       "When she saw him, and noted the Red Cross on his shield and the like\n",
       "emblem on his breast, she said to herself: “Now God be thanked, I see my\n",
       "true champion again,” and she rode to meet him, and greeted him with\n",
       "friendly words, saying: “Where have you been these weary days, my lord?\n",
       "I have fared ill without your company,” and she told him of all the\n",
       "troubles and dangers through which she had passed.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the other hand, the false knight spoke her fair: “For this cause I\n",
       "left you, dearest lady, that I might seek an adventure of which\n",
       "Archimage told me, and how I might deal with a felon who had done great\n",
       "harm to many gallant knights. And, indeed, I did deal with him, so that\n",
       "he shall hurt such knights no more. I pray you, fair lady, to pardon me\n",
       "that I left you awhile, even for such cause, and to take me once more as\n",
       "your faithful servant and champion.”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "So the two rode on together. They had not travelled many miles when they\n",
       "saw coming to them, riding at the full speed of his horse a knight fully\n",
       "armed. When he came near they saw that he was a man of very fierce\n",
       "aspect, and that he carried on his shield the name _Sansloy_. Fierce as\n",
       "he was of look, he grew fiercer yet when he perceived the false knight’s\n",
       "shield, how it had the badge of the Red Cross. Not a word did he speak,\n",
       "but he laid his spear in rest and rode fiercely forward.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sorely dismayed was Archimage, and loath to meet the stranger in battle,\n",
       "for, indeed, he was not used to bearing arms. Yet could he not hold back\n",
       "for very shame. The Lady Una also looked at him that he should bear\n",
       "himself bravely. But it fared ill with him, and, indeed, it would have\n",
       "fared worse but that his steed, being no less timorous than himself,\n",
       "held back in the onset, so that the shock of their meeting was the less\n",
       "fierce. Nevertheless, he was thrown to the ground, where he lay helpless\n",
       "and without defence.\n",
       "\n",
       "The strange knight leapt lightly from his horse, and made as though he\n",
       "would have slain his adversary. “Ha!” he cried, “so he that slew the\n",
       "brave knight Sansfoy, my brother, has come by his deserts. Sansfoy he\n",
       "slew, and by Sansloy he shall be slain!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then he began to unlace the man’s helmet as he lay upon the ground, but\n",
       "the Lady Una cried, “Oh, Sir Knight, hold your hand; is it not enough\n",
       "that you have vanquished him? He lies there at your mercy. Therefore\n",
       "have mercy upon him. Verily there is not in the whole world a truer\n",
       "knight than he.” But the stranger had no mind to hold his hand, for,\n",
       "indeed, he had no compassion within his heart. But when he had ended the\n",
       "unlacing of the helmet, and was now ready to strike, he saw the hoary\n",
       "head and wrinkled face of Archimage, and cried: “What is this that I\n",
       "see, Archimage, luckless sire? By what ill-fortune have you come across\n",
       "me in this fashion? Is the fault with me or with you, that I should have\n",
       "dealt with a friend as though he were an enemy?”\n",
       "\n",
       "So he spake, but not a word did the wizard answer. He lay in a swoon,\n",

       "could she divine how she might escape from the hand of this paynim\n",
       "knight. And now she had to bear yet another grief. For when Sansloy laid\n",
       "a rude hand upon her and bade her descend from her steed, and caught\n",
       "away her veil that he might look upon her face, the lion, not enduring\n",
       "to see his mistress so handled and treated, sprang at the knight, but\n",
       "alas! what was he to withstand a knight clad in armour of proof, with\n",
       "spear and sword? Soon did Sansloy thrust him through with the iron\n",
       "point, so that the faithful beast fell dead upon the ground, and the\n",

       "throne. And the Knight said, “Lady, we are come to see your royal state,\n",
       "and to prove the report of your great majesty which has gone through all\n",
       "the world.” “I thank you,” said the lady, but in a disdainful way, for\n",

       "rise. On the other hand, the knights and ladies set themselves with much\n",

       "content so to lose the trophy which he had won in fair fight, ran at the\n",

       "_Sansfoy_, whom he slew not in fair fight, but by magic arts, ay, and\n",
       "not possessing it only, but that he might do it dishonour, commanding\n",
       "that it should be publicly borne.” So spake Sansjoy, but the Red-Cross\n",

       "the morning light should shine upon the earth. So soon therefore as the\n",
       "sun appeared in the sky he rose from his bed, and arrayed himself in his\n",
       "armour, making ready for his combat with the Saracen. This done, he\n",
       "descended into the castle hall, where there was already gathered a great\n",
       "crowd of men, who had come to see what the issue of the day should be.\n",
       "There were musicians making melody on harps and viols, and bards who\n",
       "were ready to celebrate in song the strength and valour of him who\n",
       "should win the victory. After him by no great space of time came the\n",
       "Saracen, clad in chain armour. Fierce was his look, as though he would\n",
       "strike fear into his adversary, but the Knight was of a temper which no\n",
       "looks could dismay. Then the pages brought in two cups of wine from\n",
       "Greece, and mingled therein spices from farthest India, for such was the\n",
       "custom of the place. It was to kindle the champions’ courage forsooth,\n",
       "but neither Christian nor Saracen, I take it, had need of such\n",

       "with a great canopy over it. Before her was an open space, railed in on\n",
       "every side, that none should be near either to help or to hinder the\n",
       "champions. Over against the Queen was set another throne, of less\n",
       "account and dignity. On this was set false Duessa. And on a tree hard by\n",
       "was hung the shield of Sansfoy, and a laurel crown which should be the\n",
       "conqueror’s meed.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now was heard the shrill note of a trumpet, and the two champions\n",
       "addressed themselves to the battle. Each man carried his shield on his\n",
       "left arm, and took his sword in his right hand, for such was the order\n",
       "of the fight, that for a speedier issue they should lay aside their\n",
       "spears and take at once their swords. Both knights were sturdy and\n",
       "brave, and long they fought without advantage gained. Stroke was\n",
       "answered with stroke, while the sparks flew from either shield, and each\n",
       "helmet showed the dints where the steel had been well-nigh broken\n",
       "through. Neither did this champion or that escape without harm, for the\n",
       "blood was seen to flow out and dye their coats of mail, but neither\n",
       "suffered such a wound as to hinder him from the fight, nor did the crowd\n",
       "that watched them know which would prevail. And now it chanced that the\n",
       "Saracen, as he shifted his place, caught the sight of his brother’s\n",
       "shield, where it hung upon the tree, to be the conqueror’s prize. The\n",
       "sight stirred him to a double rage: “Ah! brother,” he cried, “dost thou\n",
       "sit so long by that dark lake of death the while thy shield hangs here\n",
       "to be the prize of victory? Go, caitiff,” so he cried, as he turned him\n",
       "to the Red-Cross Knight, “go and tell him that I have redeemed his\n",
       "shield from shame.” And as he spoke, he smote upon the crest of the\n",
       "Knight a mightier stroke by far than he had ever dealt. Twice did the\n",
       "Knight reel as he stood; twice was he ready to fall; while all that\n",
       "watched were assured that the battle was indeed won and lost, and the\n",
       "false Duessa cried aloud: “Well done, Sansjoy; the shield is yours, and\n",
       "I and all.” But when the Knight heard the voice of the lady—for he knew\n",
       "not yet her true quality—he raised himself from his swoon, and his faith\n",
       "that had waxed weak grew strong again, and the chill departed from his\n",
       "limbs. Wrath and shame and love wrought such new strength within him,\n",
       "that he struck his foe with a stroke so mighty that it brought him to\n",
       "his knee. “Ah! thou miscreant,” he cried, “go now and take yourself your\n",
       "message to this dear brother, and tell him that the conqueror has his\n",
       "shield.” But when he would have dealt yet another blow, and so ended the\n",
       "fight beyond all doubt, lo! there was a dark cloud over all the place,\n",
       "and the Saracen was nowhere to be seen. He called him aloud, but there\n",
       "came no answer. The darkness had swallowed him up. Then the false Duessa\n",
       "came down from her seat and entreated him with many words: “O most\n",
       "valiant Knight that ever lady chose for her champion, abate now your\n",
       "rage; your adversary lies low; be content with your victory.” But not\n",
       "one whit was his wrath diminished; willingly would he have driven his\n",
       "sword-hilt deep into the body of his enemy, so finishing his work. But\n",
       "nowhere could he espy him. While he stood wondering, the trumpets\n",
       "sounded again, now with a note of victory, and heralds came and paid him\n",
       "homage, making low obeisance to him, and giving into his hands the\n",
       "shield. After this they took him to the Queen, where she sat upon her\n",
       "throne; and he, bending his knee before her, made proffer of his\n",
       "service, which she accepted with much courtesy of thanks. This done, she\n",
       "returned to the palace, having the Knight by her side, the people\n",
       "following with loud shouts and much rejoicing.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now, because his wounds were many—for not without much cost of pain\n",
       "had he won this victory—they laid him in a bed and bound up his hurts,\n",
       "pouring in oil and wine, the while the musicians made sweet music to\n",
       "comfort him in his sickness. While he thus lay, Duessa resorted to a\n",
       "certain witch of whom she had knowledge, and told her of how the\n",
       "Christian Knight had slain Sansfoy, and now had stricken Sansjoy\n",
       "well-nigh to death, and prayed her help. So the two returned together to\n",
       "where the Saracen lay, still covered with the magic cloud. They bound up\n",
       "his wounds, and laid him in the witch’s car, and carried him to hell to\n",
       "the dwelling of Æsculapius. Now this Æsculapius was a great physician in\n",
       "the days of old, and because he had brought to life again a certain man\n",
       "who had been unjustly slain he had suffered grievous punishment. He\n",
       "could not die, for he was of immortal race, but he had been struck down\n",
       "to hell with a thunderbolt. There he had lain, age after age, striving,\n",
       "if it might be, to heal his own hurts. To him, therefore, the witch and\n",
       "Duessa brought Sansjoy, and prayed him that he would recover him of his\n",
       "deadly hurt. “Nay, nay,” said he, “you ask what may not be. You tempt me\n",
       "to do again the very thing for which I suffer all this pain. Shall I\n",
       "again, with a like deed, renew the wrath of him that so dealt with me?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The witch made answer: “What more can you suffer than you have suffered\n",
       "already? You hope for nothing; what then should you fear? You are in\n",
       "this lowest deep; is there a lower to which you can fall? Deny not my\n",
       "prayer; rather show the power which has given you your great renown in\n",
       "heaven and on earth and in hell itself.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Be it so,” he said. So they brought the knight, and the great physician\n",
       "used all his arts, applying to the man’s wound all the healing powers\n",
       "that he knew. Then Duessa, having accomplished her purpose, so far as it\n",
       "might be done, journeyed back to the Palace of Pride, but when she came\n",

       "furnishing, in which lay a crowd of prisoners in most miserable plight,\n",
       "men of the old times and of the new, such as were Nimrod the great\n",

       "all who by wicked pride had sinned against God and man. This had the\n",

       "no longer, but that very hour, while it was yet dark, for it would have\n",
       "gone ill with him had he been espied, he fled from the castle. By a\n",

       "Though the wizard Archimage was an ill companion for the Lady Una, yet\n",
       "was Sansloy, by whom he was overthrown, a worse. They had not travelled\n",
       "together far when he said, “Lady, deign, I pray you, to show me that\n",
       "fair face of yours. I would fain know for whom I have done battle.\n",
       "Yours, I ween, is such beauty as the old villain whom I overthrew was\n",
       "not worthy to take in charge.” And when she answered him not a word, he\n",

       "of the wood, which was hard by, a great multitude of strange creatures,\n",
       "fauns and satyrs, half man and half beast. They were dancing and making\n",
       "merry in the forest, which is their natural dwelling-place, and when\n",
       "they heard the cry, one said to another: “This is the cry of some mortal\n",
       "in distress, and it has the note of a woman’s voice; let us see what is\n",
       "the cause.” So they made all haste to the place from which the cry came.\n",

       "fast as he could. Nor, indeed, was the Lady Una wholly quit of her\n",
       "fears. So it may chance that when a wolf carries off a lamb, and drops\n",
       "it for fear of a lion, the lamb may be in no better case. But when the\n",

       "dutiful servants. So, gathering courage, she raised herself from the\n",
       "earth on which she had thrown herself in fear and distress, and made\n",
       "signs that she would go with them. So they led her through the wood,\n",
       "dancing and shouting and singing; and some strewed branches of trees on\n",
       "the ground before her, and one, who was a chief among them, put a crown\n",
       "of olive leaves about her head. So they led her to their chief Sylvanus,\n",

       "leaning on a staff of cypress wood, and having a rope of ivy knitted\n",

       "from all human company; nor did he learn letters or any craft\n",
       "whatsoever, but only to be ever of a good courage and to banish fear. So\n",
       "he would lay his hand on lions and bears, and tame the wild bulls of the\n",
       "forest, riding on them as one might ride upon a horse. And he grew to be\n",
       "so swift of foot that he would overtake the roebuck in his flight. ’Tis\n",

       "manhood he was not content with the conquest over wild beasts, or with\n",
       "life in the wood far from man. He went therefore into distant lands\n",
       "seeking adventures, in which he acquitted him so well that no man could\n",

       "indeed, by this time, being by nature of a lively wit, he had himself\n",

       "He bears a red cross on his armour.” The old man answered: “Fair lady,\n",
       "truly I have seen such an one with these eyes, and a sorry sight it was,\n",
       "for he lay dead upon the ground.” When the Lady Una heard these words\n",
       "she fell to the earth in a swoon. When Satyrane with much care had\n",
       "brought her back to life, she said: “Friend, tell me all that you know;\n",
       "one who has borne the greater pain may well endure the less.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The old traveller answered: “On a certain day—an evil day it was, and I\n",
       "am grieved that I ever lived to see it—as I chanced to be passing on my\n",
       "way, I saw two knights contending fiercely together; one was a Saracen,\n",
       "and the other bore a red cross on his shield, and he that carried this\n",
       "device was slain.” “Oh to think,” cried the Lady Una, “that he should be\n",
       "thus overcome, he that was so stout and brave. How could such an evil\n",
       "chance befall?” “That I know not, fair lady,” said the old man; “I can\n",
       "but relate the thing which I saw with mine eyes.” Then said Satyrane:\n",
       "“Tell me now, old man, where is the Saracen knight that did this deed?\n",
       "Is he far from hence or near at hand?” The old man made answer: “You may\n",
       "find him not far from here. I left him but a short time ago sitting by a\n",
       "fountain where he washed his wounds.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The knight Satyrane, having further inquired by what way he should go,\n",
       "made all haste to find the Saracen, fearing lest haply he should have\n",
       "departed. And, indeed, he found him, sitting by the fountain side under\n",
       "the shade of a tree, for it was Sansloy, the same that had overthrown\n",
       "Archimage. And Satyrane cried aloud: “Rise from your place, accursed\n",
       "miscreant, you that by some unknightly craft and treachery have slain\n",
       "the Red-Cross Knight, for I know well that you could not have overcome\n",
       "him in fair fight. Rise up, and either maintain your cause in arms, or\n",
       "confess your guilt.” The Saracen, when he heard these words, rose\n",
       "quickly from his place and put his helmet on his head, and took his\n",
       "shield upon his arm, and drew near to his adversary. But first he said:\n",
       "“Truly you have been sent hither in an evil hour to fight a quarrel that\n",
       "is not yours. And, indeed, you blame me for a deed which I have not\n",
       "done. The Red-Cross Knight I slew not, nor indeed did I engage in fight\n",
       "with him. Someone who falsely bore his arms I overthrew. But come now,\n",
       "if you may not fight in his quarrel, fight in your own.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then the two men came together in fierce encounter. When they were at\n",
       "the hottest of the fray, the Lady Una came to the place, for Satyrane\n",
       "had left her behind in his haste. And when she saw the Saracen she said\n",
       "to herself: “Now what shall I do if this false villain should get the\n",
       "upper hand of Satyrane?” And the thought struck such terror into her\n",
       "heart that she straightway turned and fled from the place. And the old\n",

       "of a spring in the shade of a tree. He had put off his armour by reason\n",

       "therein had fallen out of favour with her mistress, Diana. And the cause\n",
       "of her so falling was this. On a certain day, as Diana and her train\n",
       "were following the chase, the nymph of this spring, being wearied with\n",
       "the heat and toil of the day, sat herself down to rest. With this her\n",

       "of body and soul grew faint and feeble, but by slow degrees and\n",
       "unperceived. Ere long there came to his ears a loud bellowing sound\n",
       "which made the trees to tremble and the very earth to shake. The Knight\n",
       "leapt from the ground, and would have armed himself, but yet, such was\n",
       "the working of that magic spring, was strangely slow. Certain it is that\n",
       "ere he could don his armour or thrust his arm into the fitting of his\n",
       "shield, there came stalking along with mighty stride the most fearsome\n",
       "giant that ever was seen on the face of the earth. His stature was\n",
       "thrice that of man, and in his right hand he carried an oak tree which\n",
       "he had torn from the earth by its roots. It served him for a staff\n",
       "whereon to stay his steps, and for a mace with which to slay his foes.\n",
       "So soon as he spied the Knight he came against him with the oak tree\n",
       "lifted in his hand. On the other hand, the Knight made a vain show of\n",
       "battle, but the strength had departed from his arm, and the heart in him\n",
       "failed for fear. He lifted his sword, indeed, but he had no power to\n",
       "strike. Then the giant aimed at him a mighty blow, such as would have\n",
       "levelled to the ground a tower of stone. Verily, but for the grace and\n",
       "help of God, it had ground him to powder, but he leapt from under it,\n",
       "yet its very wind laid him prostrate on the ground. When the giant saw\n",
       "him lie helpless in this fashion, he lifted his hand again as if to slay\n",
       "him, but the false Duessa, who, for her own ends, would not have the\n",
       "Knight perish in this fashion, cried aloud: “O Orgoglio, greatest of all\n",
       "creatures under the sun, slay him not, but make him your thrall and\n",
       "slave.” The giant listened to this prayer. He took the Knight in his\n",
       "arms and carried him to his castle, and there threw him into a dungeon\n",
       "that had been dug deep into the earth. There he lay for a while, with\n",

       "him.\n",
       "\n",
       "The faithful Dwarf had seen his master fall, for he had the Knight’s\n",
       "war-horse in charge, while the beast was grazing in the meadow hard by.\n",
       "And now, the giant having departed with his prisoner, he gathered\n",
       "together the arms and the armour, for these Orgoglio had left lying on\n",
       "the ground as taking no account of such things. There was the helmet and\n",
       "the cuirass, and the greaves and the shield with the cross upon it, and\n",
       "the spear—things sad to behold, now that there was none to wear or wield\n",
       "them. He laid them on the back of the war-horse, and so departed. He had\n",
       "not gone far before he met the Lady Una herself. When she saw him and\n",
       "the war-horse and the burden which it bore, there was no spirit left in\n",
       "her, so that she fell without sense to the ground. Willingly would the\n",
       "faithful Dwarf have died, knowing what ill tidings he bore, and seeing\n",
       "how ill they were taken. Nevertheless he did not lose heart, but with\n",
       "much pain and care sought to recover the lady from her swoon. Thrice did\n",
       "he bring her back to life, and thrice she fell as one dead to the\n",
       "ground. At last, when the spirit within her had somewhat recovered\n",
       "itself, she said with faltering tongue: “Tell me now, faithful friend,\n",
       "the whole story from the beginning, how it is that I see these relics of\n",
       "the bravest knight that ever was. Verily Fortune has spent all her spite\n",

       "had ended his tale she said: “Verily I will seek him as long as I live.\n",
       "Lead on, and show me the way that I must go.” So they travelled both\n",
       "together.\n",
       "\n",
       "They had not journeyed far before they met a knight riding on the way\n",
       "with his squire behind him. Never was there more gallant warrior or more\n",
       "gallantly arrayed. His armour shone like the sun, and across his breast\n",
       "he wore a baldrick richly adorned with precious stones. Costly were they\n",
       "all, but one among them shone most excellently, a great diamond like to\n",
       "the head of a fair lady, brighter than all the rest, even as the star of\n",
       "evening is brighter than all the hosts of heaven. His sword hung from\n",
       "his side in a sheath cunningly made of ivory; its hilt was of burnished\n",
       "gold, and its buckle also of gold. The crest of his helmet was a great\n",
       "dragon, with wings spread out on either side, and above the crest a\n",
       "horse-hair plume, which waved to and fro as an almond tree waves its\n",
       "blossoms in the breath of spring. But the great marvel of his equipment\n",
       "was his shield. It was not made of iron or of brass, as are the shields\n",
       "of common men, but of one great diamond. Only it was covered up from\n",
       "sight. When he would dismay some huge monster, or strike with fear some\n",
       "great array of the enemy, then he would show its brightness. No power of\n",
       "man, no enchantments, strong and subtle as they might be, could prevail\n",
       "against it, or diminish aught of its power, for indeed it was made by\n",
       "the greatest magician that ever lived upon the earth, even Merlin.\n",
       "\n",
       "The gallant knight spake full courteously to the Lady Una, asking if he\n",

       "sorrow is so great that it is past all remedy. What would it profit to\n",
       "tell the tale? ’Tis best to hide it in my heart nor stir the hidden\n",
       "grief.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay, lady,” answered the knight, “I doubt not that your grief is great,\n",
       "but I would counsel you to tell the tale for all it is so sad. Pain is\n",
       "ever lessened, be it ever so great, by wise counsel, and he who will not\n",
       "reveal his trouble may never find help.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So they spake together, he persuading her to reveal her sorrow and she\n",
       "unwilling to bring it to the light, till at last, yielding to his words\n",
       "of wisdom, she told her tale.\n",
       "\n",

       "this enterprise, to subdue the dragon and to deliver those whom he\n",
       "oppresses. From every country under heaven have they come, brave men and\n",
       "famous for great deeds, but they have failed, one and all. For want of\n",
       "faith or for the hidden weakness of some secret sin they have fallen\n",
       "before him. At last there came to our land a report of certain famous\n",

       "knight who should deliver my father and mother from the power of the\n",
       "tyrant. Nor did I go in vain. It was my good fortune to find a gallant\n",
       "knight who was fit and willing to undertake this task. Unproved indeed\n",
       "he was, but he was of a fair body and a noble soul. It was he who set\n",
       "forth upon this enterprise. Of his prowess I saw full many a proof. Yea,\n",
       "the sword and the spear which you see on the back of yonder steed might\n",
       "tell, if they could speak, of the great deeds which he has wrought. But\n",
       "by ill chance he encountered a most false magician, by whose arts he was\n",
       "betrayed. First this vile creature made division between my knight and\n",
       "me, so that he misdoubted of my faith. Next he delivered him to the\n",
       "wiles of a certain false woman, Duessa by name. And she has betrayed him\n",
       "into the hands of a great and terrible giant, Orgoglio by name. And in\n",

       "When they had travelled a score of miles or so, they came to a castle\n",
       "which was built very high and strong. Thereupon the Dwarf cried out,\n",
       "“This is the place in which my good lord lies a prisoner, the thrall of\n",
       "the giant Orgoglio.” Thereupon the Prince Arthur alighted from his\n",
       "steed, and said to the Lady Una, “Stay here, madam, and await the issue\n",
       "of this day’s combat.” Then, at his bidding, the squire came near to the\n",
       "wall of the castle. He found the gates fast shut, with no warder to\n",
       "guard them, nor was there any to answer when he called. Then the squire\n",
       "took in his hand a bugle that he bore, that hung by his side with a\n",
       "chain of gold decked with gay tassels. It was a bugle of wondrous power;\n",
       "for three miles it could be heard, and there came out of space three\n",
       "answers to its blast, nor could anyone in whose heart there was aught of\n",
       "falsehood endure to hear it without dismay, nor could any bolt or bar,\n",
       "however stout they might be, withstand its summons. This bugle, then,\n",
       "Prince Arthur’s squire sounded before the giant’s castle. And it was\n",
       "shaken straightway from the foundation to the topmost towers, and the\n",
       "doors flew open of their own accord. The giant himself was much troubled\n",
       "at the sound, and came with staggering steps, as one smitten with a\n",
       "sudden fear, to see what it might mean. And after came the false Duessa,\n",
       "riding on a many-headed beast, with fiery tongues, for such a monster\n",
       "the giant had given her for her own.\n",
       "\n",
       "Prince Arthur without delay addressed himself to the fight. Nor did the\n",
       "giant draw back, being persuaded that no mortal man could stand up\n",
       "against him and prevail. He thought, indeed, to slay him with a single\n",
       "blow, and lifted up his mighty club. But the Prince was wise and wary,\n",
       "and, lightly leaping aside, he escaped the stroke unhurt, for he thought\n",
       "it no shame to use his craft against brute strength. As for the club, so\n",
       "missing its aim, it sank deep into the earth, making a furrow a yard\n",
       "deep and more. The giant pulled at it amain, seeking to lift it for\n",
       "another stroke, but could not prevail, so fast was it buried. The\n",
       "knight, therefore, had him at a disadvantage, and smote him with his\n",
       "sword so deadly a stroke that it shore off his arm. Loud did he bellow\n",
       "with fear and pain, and Duessa, seeing her champion in sore distress,\n",
       "made the great beast on which she sat advance against the Knight. But\n",
       "now Prince Arthur’s squire, a gallant warrior, worthy of such a lord,\n",
       "stood forth and, with his single sword, barred the way. In high disdain\n",
       "to be hindered by so weak a foe Duessa yet again urged on the beast, but\n",
       "still the squire stood firm; he would not give place a single step lest\n",
       "the enemy should so gain an advantage against his lord. Then Duessa had\n",
       "recourse to her magic arts, for she took of the magic juices which she\n",
       "ever carried with her, and sprinkled them upon the youth, and quenched\n",
       "his courage and robbed him of his strength, so that he could neither see\n",
       "nor stand. So he fell all his length upon the earth, and the beast laid\n",
       "his deadly claws upon his neck, and would have crushed the life out of\n",
       "him. But the Knight, perceiving his evil plight, turned quickly from his\n",
       "own adversary, and addressed himself to the beast, for, indeed, it\n",
       "grieved him much that his faithful squire should have come into such\n",
       "peril of his life. So, lifting high the sword with which he had smitten\n",
       "the giant, he smote the beast upon one of its heads, making the blood\n",
       "pour out amain. But when the beast, writhing to and fro in its pain,\n",
       "would have shaken Duessa from her seat upon its back, and she cried out\n",
       "in her fear, the giant came to her help. He was, indeed, of no common\n",
       "nature, nor was he disabled by the wound which would have bereft all\n",
       "other creatures of strength. In the one hand which was left to him there\n",
       "dwelt the strength of the two, and now being free to use again his club\n",
       "of oak, he lifted it up high and dealt such a blow at Prince Arthur’s\n",
       "shield that it brought him to the ground. But now by this very stroke\n",
       "the Knight’s deliverance was wrought, for the covering was torn from the\n",
       "shield by its violence, and all its brightness was revealed. With so\n",
       "great a splendour did it blaze into the giant’s eyes that he dropped his\n",
       "arm and let fall the club with which he was ready to slay his adversary.\n",
       "The beast also was blinded by that brightness, and fell reft of its\n",
       "senses on the ground. Nor when Duessa cried aloud to the giant in her\n",
       "fear could he render effectual help. With stroke after stroke the Prince\n",
       "lopped from him limb after limb, till he lay dead upon the ground. And\n",
       "then this marvel came to pass. This creature which had seemed so vast\n",
       "seemed to vanish away. As for Duessa, she sprang from off the beast, and\n",
       "would have fled away upon her feet. But this the squire would not\n",
       "suffer, for, pursuing her with speedy feet, he laid hold of her and\n",
       "brought her back to the Prince to await his judgment.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now the Lady Una, who in fear and trembling had watched the combat\n",
       "from a distance, came near and thanked both Knight and squire for the\n",
       "good service which they had rendered. “I cannot repay you,” she said;\n",
       "“may Heaven give you your reward and with usury. Suffer me to say one\n",
       "thing. Let not this false woman depart, for, indeed, she is the cause of\n",
       "all the mischief that has been wrought.” Then Prince Arthur said to his\n",
       "squire: “Take this woman in charge; I will go seek the Red-Cross\n",
       "Knight.” So he departed on this errand, and, entering the castle, sought\n",
       "someone of whom he might inquire. No one did he find, and though he\n",
       "called aloud, there was none to answer. At last there came forth an old\n",
       "man leaning on a staff with which he guided his steps, for the sight of\n",
       "his eyes had failed him long since, and carrying a great bunch of keys,\n",
       "but all of them overgrown with rust. His name was Ignaro. A reverend\n",
       "sire he seemed, and the Knight asked him with all courtesy: “Who are\n",
       "they that dwell in this place, and where may they be found?” “I cannot\n",
       "tell,” he said. Then the Prince asked again: “Where, then, is the Knight\n",
       "whom the giant Orgoglio holds in thrall?” “I cannot tell,” said he\n",
       "again, nor did he say any other words. The Prince’s anger rose at this\n",
       "foolishness, but he checked it as should a courteous knight, and, taking\n",
       "the keys from the old man’s hand, essayed to open the doors, nor did\n",
       "they delay to yield. Great riches he found within—store of gold, and\n",
       "tapestry finely wrought, and much splendid furnishing; but the floor was\n",
       "foul with blood. Vainly did he search through all the chambers; the\n",
       "prisoner he could not find. At last he came to an iron door. It was fast\n",
       "locked, nor was there a key upon the bunch that would open it. But in\n",
       "the door there was a grating of iron bars. Through this he called aloud:\n",
       "“Dwells there anyone in this place, for I will set him free?” To this\n",
       "there came a low voice making this reply: “Who is that who comes? Three\n",
       "months have I lain in this foul dungeon, and if you bring me death\n",
       "itself I would choose it rather than to stay in this place.” When the\n",
       "Prince heard these words he was overcome with horror and pity; not the\n",
       "less, gathering up all his strength, he smote the door, and brake it\n",
       "from its hinges. But when the opening was made, lo! on the other side\n",
       "was no floor but only a deep pit, dark as night, from which there came\n",
       "up a loathsome smell. But neither the pit nor the darkness nor the vile\n",
       "stench abated the Prince’s courage. With much pains and toil he drew up\n",
       "the prisoner from the pit. Sadly wasted was he. He could not stand upon\n",
       "his feet, and his eyes, deep sunk in the sockets, could not bear to look\n",
       "upon the light, and his arms that had been so staunch and strong in the\n",
       "old time were wasted to the bone. So the Prince carried him to the\n",
       "castle door. And when the Lady Una saw him, she was filled with pity and\n",
       "ruth and would have comforted him: “Welcome, my lord,” she cried, “whom\n",
       "I have so long desired to see. Soon shall you have a recompense for all\n",
       "that you have suffered.” “Dear lady,” he made answer, “we will not speak\n",
       "of the evil that is past; only let us beware that we fall not into it\n",
       "again. For, indeed, there is engraven in my heart, as with a pen of\n",
       "iron, this true saying: ‘Happiness may not abide in the heart of mortal\n",
       "man.’”\n",
       "\n",

       "was a time when I laughed at the name of Love, and thought scorn of all\n",
       "that suffered from its power. But there came a time when I myself\n",
       "confessed it. On a certain day, being wearied out with sport, I laid me\n",

       "when the time should come. Such was my dream; whether it was false or\n",

       "anon, he cast a look behind him as though an enemy were close at his\n",

       "his hair bristled with fear, while his face was as pale as death, and\n",
       "that round his neck was a rope of hemp, which, indeed, ill agreed with\n",
       "his shining armour. But he made no account, so overcome with fear was\n",
       "he, either of rope or of arms. The Red-Cross Knight rode as fast as he\n",
       "could so as to meet him as he fled, and said to him: “Tell me, Sir\n",

       "now reproach, at last put some little heart into him, so that he could\n",
       "tell his tale, and the tale was this—\n",
       "\n",
       "“I chanced of late to be in company with a gentle knight, Sir Terwin by\n",
       "name. He was a man of good repute for courage and skill in arms, but he\n",
       "fared ill in one matter, in that he loved a fair lady who had but little\n",
       "love for him, but rather took pleasure in seeing him languish and\n",
       "lament. On a certain day as we were coming away from the lady’s\n",
       "dwelling—for he had been paying her court, and had been most\n",
       "disdainfully treated—we met a stranger who greeted us courteously, and,\n",
       "as we fared on together, told us many wonderful tales of great\n",
       "adventures. When he had in this way won our regard, he inquired with a\n",
       "show of friendship of our condition, and when he had heard the same, and\n",
       "knew that we suffered not a little distress in this matter of love, for\n",
       "I, too, was not less troubled in this respect than was my friend, he\n",
       "began to talk to us in the most gloomy fashion, taking from us all hope\n",
       "of relief, and in the end counselling us to end our troubles with death.\n",
       "And that we might do this the more easily, he gave to me this rope and\n",
       "to Sir Terwin a rusty knife. With this said knife Sir Terwin, unhappy\n",
       "man that he was, forthwith slew himself; but I, whether I was more faint\n",
       "of heart or more fortunate I know not, fled away with all speed.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I would see this fellow,” said the Red-Cross Knight, “and deal with him\n",
       "according to his deserts.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay,” said the other, whose name was Trevisan, “I counsel you not to go\n",
       "within hearing of his speech, so powerful is he to persuade.” And when\n",
       "the Red-Cross Knight was urgent to go, Sir Trevisan answered: “To do\n",
       "your pleasure, friend, I will show the place, but I myself would sooner\n",
       "die than enter.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So they two rode together, and the Lady Una with them, till they came to\n",
       "the place. It was a gloomy cave in the side of a rock, on the top of\n",
       "which there sat an owl making a doleful screech. By the side of the cave\n",
       "were stocks of trees without leaf or fruit, but with the carcases of men\n",
       "hanging upon them, and on the ground beneath were other bodies, which\n",
       "had fallen down by lapse of years. Sir Trevisan would have fled when he\n",
       "saw the place, but the other would not suffer it. They entered the cave\n",
       "and saw the man sitting on the ground within. His grisly hair fell in\n",
       "long locks about his neck, and his eyes were deadly dull and his cheeks\n",
       "sunken, as if it were with hunger and grief. His garments were dirty and\n",
       "patched, being fastened together with thorns. And on the ground beside\n",
       "him there lay the corpse of a man, newly slain, whose blood had not yet\n",
       "ceased to flow from the wound. Then said the Red-Cross Knight, “What say\n",
       "you, wicked man, why you should not be straightway judged for the evil\n",
       "deed which you have done?” “What words are these, stranger?” said the\n",
       "man, “and what judgment is this? Why should he live who desires to die?\n",
       "Is it against justice that a man should have his due? Or, again, to\n",
       "speak of charity rather than justice, is it not well to help him over\n",
       "that comes to a great flood, or to free the feet that stick fast in the\n",
       "mire? He that lies there enjoys the rest which you desire and cannot\n",
       "have. Somewhat painful the passage, it cannot be denied, yet how great\n",
       "and how sweet the rest! Is it not well to endure short pain for so long\n",
       "a happiness? Sleep after toil, port after stormy seas, ease after war,\n",
       "death after life, what better can you ask?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay,” answered the Knight, “the time of a man’s life is ordered. No one\n",
       "may shorten it at his will; no, nor any soldier quit the post at which\n",
       "he has been set.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Say you so?” replied the other. “If all things have their appointed\n",
       "end, who shall deny that the end which you shall yourself set is of the\n",
       "things appointed by Fate? Remember also this: the longer the life the\n",
       "more the sin, and the more the sin the greater the punishment. Once you\n",
       "have missed the right way—and who has not missed it?—the further you\n",
       "stray. And have you not strayed, Sir Knight? Bethink you what you have\n",
       "endured, and what you have done amiss. What of the lady whom you swore\n",
       "to champion and so shamefully deserted? What of the false Duessa to whom\n",
       "you so basely pledged yourself? Does not the law say, ‘He that sins\n",
       "shall die’? Die, therefore, as becomes a brave man, without delay, and\n",
       "of your own accord.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The Knight was greatly troubled by these words, for indeed there were\n",
       "many things of which his conscience accused him, so that he trembled and\n",
       "grew faint, which, when the Fiend perceived, he showed him a picture in\n",
       "which was set forth the sufferings of lost souls; and, after this,\n",
       "perceiving him to be yet more confounded, he brought to him a sword, and\n",
       "poison, and a rope, bidding him choose the death by which he would\n",
       "rather die. And when the Knight took none of these, he put into his hand\n",
       "a sharp knife. Once and again did the Knight lift it up as if to strike;\n",
       "but when the Lady Una saw it, she snatched the knife out of his hand,\n",
       "crying, “Fie, fie on thee, faint hearted! Is this the battle which you\n",
       "promised to fight against the dragon of the fiery mouth? Come away; let\n",
       "not these idle words dismay your heart. You are chosen to a great work;\n",
       "why should you despair? Surely Mercy rejoices against Judgment, and the\n",
       "greater the need, the greater the grace. Come, let us leave this\n",
       "accursed place.” Then the Knight rose up and departed. And when the\n",
       "Fiend saw him depart, he took a halter and put it round his neck, and\n",
       "was fain to hang himself. But this he could not do; many times had he\n",
       "essayed the same, but had ever failed.\n",
       "\n",
       "As they journeyed on the Lady Una perceived that her Knight, for all\n",
       "that he was healed of his sickness, was feeble and faint, and unfit for\n",
       "combat, if such should come in his way. Now she knew of an ancient house\n",
       "of rest which was in those parts where he might have refreshment and\n",
       "recover his strength. The hostess’ name was Cælia, which, being\n",
       "interpreted, is Heavenly, and she had three daughters—Fidelia and\n",
       "Speranza and Charissa, the last a matron with fair children, the others\n",
       "maidens promised in marriage. There the Knight tarried many days. Much\n",
       "discipline did he endure for the removing of his faults and weaknesses,\n",
       "and much comfort also was ministered to him, and many things was he\n",
       "taught. And when his heart had been thus strengthened and purified, then\n",
       "did the Lady Cælia commend him to the care of a most venerable sire who\n",
       "was chief among her ministers. The same showed him many fair and noble\n",
       "sights, and last of all, on a mountain side, a way that was both steep\n",
       "and long, and at the end of the way a fair city, whose walls were\n",
       "builded high of pearls and all manner of precious stones. And as the\n",
       "Knight gazed thereat, he saw angels ascending thereto and descending\n",
       "therefrom. Then said he to his guide: “Tell me, sir, what city do I see\n",
       "yonder?” “That,” answered he, “is the New Jerusalem which God has built\n",
       "as a dwelling-place for his children.” “Verily,” said the Knight, “I\n",
       "thought that Cleopolis, the abode of the great Gloriana, was the fairest\n",
       "of all cities. But this does far excel it.” “Yea,” answered the holy\n",
       "man, “that is true beyond all doubt; and yet this same Cleopolis is\n",
       "worthy to be the abode of all true knights, and the service of Queen\n",
       "Gloriana a most honourable thing. And you, fair sir, have chosen a good\n",
       "part, rendering thus obedience to her command, and succouring on her\n",
       "behalf this distressed lady. And I give you this counsel: When you have\n",
       "won your great victory, and have hung your shield high among the shields\n",
       "of the most famous knights of the world, then turn your thoughts to\n",
       "better things; wash your hands clean from the stain of blood, for blood,\n",
       "though it be shed in a righteous cause, must make a stain. So shall you\n",
       "tread the steep and narrow path which leads to this fair city, the New\n",
       "Jerusalem. There is a mansion prepared for you. Thus you shall be\n",
       "numbered among the saints, and shall be the friend and patron of the\n",
       "land which gave you birth, having for your style and title Saint George\n",
       "of England.” Then said the Knight, “Dare I hope, being such as I am, to\n",
       "attain to such a grace?” “Yea,” said the Sage, “others of the like\n",
       "degree have so attained.” “But must I leave behind all the delights of\n",
       "war and love?” “Be content,” answered the Sage; “in that joy are all\n",
       "joys fulfilled.” “But,” said the Knight, “if this world is so vain a\n",
       "thing, why should I turn to it again? May I not abide here in peace till\n",
       "I can set forth on that last voyage?” “Nay,” said the Sage, “that may\n",
       "not be. Thou must maintain this lady’s cause, and do the work that has\n",
       "been committed to you. But now learn the secret of your birth. You are\n",
       "of the ancient race of British kings; but a fairy stole you from your\n",
       "cradle, and laid you in a furrow. There a certain ploughman found you,\n",
       "and, designing to bring you up to his own craft, called you George,\n",
       "which is by interpretation, ‘worker of the earth.’”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The time was now come when the Red-Cross Knight must perform the task\n",
       "which he had taken in hand. He departed therefore from the House of\n",
       "Rest; nor had he journeyed far when the Lady Una said to him: “See now\n",
       "the brazen tower in which my father and mother are imprisoned for fear\n",
       "of the dragon, and lo! there is the watchman on the wall waiting for\n",
       "good tidings.” Scarcely had she spoken when they heard a dreadful sound\n",
       "of roaring, and, looking, they saw the dragon lying on the sunny side of\n",
       "a hill, and he was like a hill himself, so great he was. Nor did he fail\n",
       "to note the glitter of arms, for he was a watchful beast, and made all\n",
       "haste to meet his enemy.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said the Knight to Una: “The hour is come; stand aside on yonder\n",
       "hill where you may watch the battle and be safe yourself.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile the dragon came on, half flying and half on foot, such haste\n",
       "did he make. Never was seen upon the earth so terrible a beast. He\n",
       "looked like to a mountain as he came, so much of the earth did he cover,\n",
       "so high did he rear himself in air, so broad a shadow did he cast. He\n",
       "was covered all over with scales as of brass or iron, fitting so close\n",
       "together that neither edge of sword nor point of spear could pierce\n",
       "them. On either side he spread out two great wings like to the sails of\n",
       "some tall ship. Behind was a great tail, wound in a hundred folds and\n",
       "covering full three furlongs. Huge knots it had, each like to a shield,\n",
       "and at the end were two great stings, armed each with deadliest poison.\n",
       "But more cruel even than the stings were his claws, so mighty were they\n",
       "and so sharp to rend asunder all that they should touch; and yet more\n",
       "cruel than his claws was his monstrous head, with rows of teeth, strong\n",
       "as iron, set in either jaw, while out of his throat came forth a smoking\n",
       "breath with sulphurous stench. Deep set in his head were his two great\n",
       "eyes, large as shields and burning with wrath as with fire, like to two\n",
       "broad beacons set upon a hill to give warning of the foe’s approach to\n",
       "all the shires around.\n",
       "\n",
       "Such was the dragon to behold, and as he came on he might be seen to\n",
       "rear his neck as in pride, while his scales bristled with anger—a\n",
       "dreadful sight, which made even the Knight’s bold heart grow cold for a\n",
       "space with fear. But not the less boldly did he address himself to the\n",
       "fight. Laying his spear in rest he charged with all his might. Full on\n",
       "the monster’s carcase struck the spear, but could not pierce those\n",
       "scales, so stout and closely set they were. Only so shrewd was the blow\n",
       "that the dragon felt the shock within: never had such been dealt to him\n",
       "before, though he had met many a gallant knight in combat. So he spread\n",
       "wide his wings, and, lifting himself in air, circled round till,\n",
       "swooping down, he seized Knight and steed with his claws and lifted them\n",
       "from the earth. For a whole bow-shot’s length he carried them, but then\n",
       "was constrained to loose them, so fierce the struggle which they made.\n",
       "So you may see a hawk, when he has pounced upon some bird that is too\n",
       "heavy for his flight, carry his prey awhile, but is then constrained to\n",
       "drop him from his claws. Again did the Knight, so restored to the earth,\n",
       "charge his foe. Again did the spear glance aside, though there was the\n",
       "force as of three men in the blow. Yet was not the thrust all in vain.\n",
       "So fierce was the shock that the dragon was constrained to raise his\n",
       "wing, and there, where the flesh was bare of shelter, the spear point\n",
       "made a grisly wound. The beast caught the spear shaft with his claws and\n",
       "brake it short, but the head stuck fast, while the blood poured out\n",
       "amain. Then, in his rage, he vomited forth great flames of fire, and,\n",
       "bending round his tail, caught the Knight’s horse by the legs, and he,\n",
       "fiercely struggling to free himself, threw his rider to the ground. Ill\n",
       "content with this fall, for it seemed as a dishonour to him, he snatched\n",
       "his sword—of his spear he had been bereft—and smote the dragon on his\n",
       "crest. The crest did not yield to the blow, so stoutly was it cased\n",
       "about, but the creature felt the shock through all his mighty frame. Yet\n",
       "again the Knight smote him, and once more the sword glanced aside as if\n",
       "from a rock of adamant, yet was not the labour spent in vain, for now\n",
       "the beast, seeking to avoid his enemy, would have raised himself in air,\n",
       "but that the wounded wing could not perform its office. Then, in his\n",
       "fury, he brayed aloud, and vomited forth from his throat so fierce a\n",
       "flame that it scorched the face of the Knight, and set his beard on\n",
       "fire, and seared his flesh through his armour. Grievous was the pain,\n",
       "and scarcely to be borne, not less than that which Hercules of old\n",
       "endured when the fiery robe steeped in the Centaur’s blood wrapped him\n",
       "round.[1] He stood astonished and helpless. And when the dragon saw how\n",
       "he fared he dealt him a great blow with his tail, and so brought him\n",
       "headlong to the ground. Then, indeed, it had gone ill with him, but for\n",
       "the happy chance that behind him there was a spring which sent forth a\n",
       "stream of water, silvery bright and of great virtue for the healing of\n",
       "all wounds and sicknesses. Men in the old time, before the dragon had\n",
       "wasted the land, called it the Well of Life, and though it was now for\n",
       "the most part forgotten, yet had it not lost its healing powers. It\n",
       "could restore him that was wasted with sickness, ay, and raise the dead.\n",
       "There was no spring on earth that could be matched with it. But of this\n",
       "the dragon was unaware—how should he know of such things?—only when he\n",
       "saw his adversary fall headlong into the water he clapped his wings for\n",
       "joy. This the Lady Una saw from the hill whereon she sat watching the\n",
       "fight. Sorely did it dismay her. Nevertheless she did not wholly lose\n",
       "her hope, but prayed all night to God that it might yet be well with the\n",
       "Knight.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the next morning dawned in the sky she looked, and lo! her champion\n",
       "stood all refreshed and ready for the fray. Nor did the dragon draw back\n",
       "from the encounter. Straightway the Knight, lifting high his sword,\n",
       "dealt a great blow at the monster’s crest, and this time, whether the\n",
       "sacred spring had given a keener edge to the steel or had put new\n",
       "strength into the arm which wielded it, it did that which never steel\n",
       "had done before, for it made a great yawning wound. Then the dragon,\n",
       "wrought to fury by the pain, lifted his tail high over his head, and\n",
       "brought down upon his adversary the deadly double sting which lay in the\n",
       "end. Through the shield it made its way, and fixed itself in his\n",
       "shoulder. Grievous was the smart, but the Knight, thinking only of\n",
       "victory and honour, did not flinch beneath it, but, gathering all his\n",
       "strength, shore off the furthest joints of the tail, so that not the\n",
       "half of it was left. But not yet was the battle won. For now the dragon\n",
       "laid his two mighty claws upon the Knight, seizing his foot with one and\n",
       "his shield with the other. Sorely was he now beset, for though with a\n",
       "blow of his sword he rid himself of the one claw, the other held him\n",
       "fast. At the same time there burst forth from the monsters mouth such\n",
       "blasts of fire, such clouds of smoke, that he was constrained to retire\n",
       "a little backward, and so, retiring, he slipped in the mire and fell.\n",
       "Yet the matter turned to his good, for the same Spring of Life refreshed\n",
       "and healed him as before, nor did the dragon dare to come near, for he\n",
       "could not have aught to do with a thing so pure and holy. And so the\n",
       "second day came to its ending.\n",
       "\n",
       "This night also did the Lady Una pray for her Knight throughout the\n",
       "hours of darkness, and the morning found her watching as before. But\n",
       "with the third day came a speedy end to that fierce encounter. The\n",
       "dragon, full of rage to be so baulked of his prey, ran at the Knight\n",
       "with mouth wide open as if to swallow him alive. And he was not slow to\n",
       "seize the occasion, for his foe had laid bare before him its most vital\n",
       "part. Right into the monster’s mouth he drove his sword with all the\n",
       "strength that was in him. Nor had he need to strike again, for the\n",
       "monster fell as falls some cliff which the waves of the sea for many\n",
       "years have worn away. High and strong it seems to stand, but it falls\n",

       "Queen Gloriana.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he was travelling with this purpose in his heart, he came upon a very\n",
       "noble knight, clad in armour from top to toe, who was riding slowly\n",
       "along the road, reigning back his horse’s pace to suit the steps of a\n",
       "venerable pilgrim, who journeyed by his side. Archimage laid his hand\n",
       "upon the neck of the knight’s horse and said: “Sir Knight, I pray you to\n",
       "help one who is sadly in need of succour for himself and for another, of\n",
       "whom he is in charge.” And while he spoke he made great pretence of fear\n",
       "and trouble, trembling and weeping.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Speak on,” answered Sir Guyon, for this was the knight’s name. “Speak\n",
       "on, and I will not fail to help you, and the other of whom you speak.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, sir,” said Archimage, “I am a squire, and I have a lady in charge\n",
       "to deliver her to her parents, but there is a certain evil-minded Knight\n",
       "who hinders me. I know not what I shall do, and she goes in deadly fear\n",
       "that some great harm will happen to her.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“And where is the lady?” asked Sir Guyon.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Come, sir,” the false squire made answer, “and I will bring you to\n",
       "her.” So the two went together, and found a lady sitting under a tree,\n",
       "weeping sore, with her garments all dishevelled and torn.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Fair lady,” said Sir Guyon, “it troubles me much to see you in this\n",
       "plight. But take heart; I will surely call him who has done you any\n",
       "wrong to strict account. But let me hear your complaint.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So she told him her tale. And when she had ended he said: “But who is\n",
       "this man; by what name or by what signs shall I know him?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“His name,” said she, “I know not; but this I know, that he rode upon a\n",
       "steed of dappled grey, and that he carried a shield of silver with a red\n",
       "cross upon it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Now by my head,” cried Sir Guyon, “I know this same Knight, and I\n",
       "wonder such that he should have behaved so ill. He is a good Knight and\n",
       "a true, and, I hear, has won great renown in the cause of a fair lady. I\n",
       "was myself present in the Queen’s court when he took this task upon\n",
       "himself, which he has now performed with great honour. Nevertheless, I\n",
       "will try him in this matter, and he must needs either show that he is\n",
       "free from blame, or make due amends.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Now she that made all this show of grief was the false Duessa, and\n",
       "Archimage had found her wandering in miserable plight after Prince\n",
       "Arthur had dealt with her as has been told above. And having found her,\n",
       "he decked her out with robes and ornaments, and made her to appear\n",
       "passing fair, such arts he had. This he did because she helped him much\n",
       "when he would tempt a knight into evil ways.\n",
       "\n",
       "“And now, squire,” said Sir Guyon, “can you lead me to the place where\n",
       "the Knight of whom you make this complaint may be found?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“That can I,” said Archimage; and he led him to a shady valley hard by,\n",
       "in the midst of which was a stream both clear and cold, and on the bank\n",
       "of the stream sat a knight with his helmet unlaced, who drank of the\n",
       "water as one who was resting after a long journey. “Sir,” said\n",
       "Archimage, “yonder is the evil Knight; he would fain hide himself from\n",
       "the punishment of his deeds.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Sir Guyon addressed himself to the fight, and the Red-Cross Knight\n",
       "likewise. But ere they encountered each other they stayed their hands:\n",
       "“Pardon me, fair sir, that I had well-nigh set my spear against the\n",
       "sacred badge which you bear upon your shield.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“And I, too,” answered the Red-Cross Knight, “would likewise crave\n",
       "pardon for like violence to that fair image of a maiden which is your\n",
       "device.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then they held converse together. Sir Guyon told his tale, but when he\n",
       "had ended it he looked, and lo! the false squire, the deceiver\n",
       "Archimage, had fled, knowing that his device had come to naught. And now\n",
       "the pilgrim that bore Sir Guyon company came up, and when he saw the\n",
       "Red-Cross Knight, he said: “Fair son, God give you praise and peace for\n",
       "ever. You indeed have won your place; but ours is yet to win.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“His be the praise,” answered the Red-Cross Knight, “by whose grace I am\n",
       "what I am.” So they parted with much courtesy, going each his several\n",
       "way.\n",
       "\n",
       "After a while they came to a fair castle by the sea where the Lady\n",
       "Medina had her dwelling, Sir Guyon toiling painfully on foot, because,\n",
       "when he was helping an unhappy traveller, a knave had stolen away his\n",
       "horse. This Lady Medina was one of three sisters, and of the three\n",
       "Elissa was the eldest and Perissa the youngest. These two were always at\n",
       "variance, not a little with Medina, but still more with each other, and\n",
       "she being always of an equal mind, and wise conduct, had the chief\n",
       "authority in the place, though, indeed, their father had left it to the\n",
       "three in equal shares. Elissa had for lover a certain Sir Hudibras, a\n",
       "famous knight, but in deeds scarce equal to his high repute. He had a\n",
       "most mighty body and sturdy limbs, but his wit was small. Perissa’s\n",
       "knight was Sansloy, of whom mention has already been made. Never was man\n",
       "more reckless, indeed, more careless of right and wrong. So soon as\n",
       "these two heard that a stranger knight was come to the castle, then they\n",
       "issued forth to fight with him, their ladies following; yet such was\n",
       "their folly that even on the way they fell out and joined in deadly\n",
       "fray, to the great disturbance of the house. Much did Sir Guyon marvel\n",
       "as, entering the hall, he saw the fray.\n",
       "\n",
       "“This,” said he to himself, “must have an end,” and, carrying his shield\n",
       "on his left arm and with his right hand unsheathing his sword, he ran in\n",
       "between the two. They with one consent turned their arms against him,\n",
       "just as a bear and tiger in the desert plains of Africa, when some\n",
       "traveller comes in sight, leave their strife and fall upon him with one\n",
       "mind. It was a strange fight indeed, and Sir Guyon had fared ill, but\n",
       "for his surpassing strength and courage, and even these might have\n",
       "failed him in a conflict so unequal, but that the Lady Medina, hearing\n",
       "in her bower of what had befallen, ran forth, with bare bosom and\n",
       "dishevelled hair, and fell on her knees and besought them to abate their\n",
       "strife: “Now, my lords!” she cried, “by the mothers that bare you, and\n",
       "by the love that you have for your fair ladies, and by the knighthood to\n",
       "which you owe your homage, I beseech you to put away this fury and to be\n",
       "at peace among yourselves.” So she besought them, and though the two\n",
       "sisters stood by, not helping a whit, but rather stirring up each her\n",
       "champion to fiercer wrath, she prevailed. The knights let fall their\n",
       "swords, and bowed their heads before her, and vowed to do her bidding.\n",
       "Then she, fearing that their resolve might be unstable, bound them by a\n",
       "treaty, which they, on their part, swore, on their knightly honour, that\n",
       "they would keep for all time to come.\n",
       "\n",
       "This done she bade them all, both knights and ladies, to a fair banquet.\n",
       "And when they had had enough of meat and drink, she said: “Tell us, Sir\n",
       "Knight, on what errand you are come and what end you seek.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said Sir Guyon: “What you ask brings to my mind that great Queen,\n",
       "fairest and best of all that are in the wide world. She is wont to make\n",
       "a great feast on the first day of the New Year, to which come all\n",
       "knights that seek adventure and desire to gain honour for themselves. At\n",
       "this feast, at the beginning of the self-same year, I was present; and\n",
       "it came to pass that this pilgrim whom you have bidden with me to your\n",
       "feast, stood forth before the Queen, and made his complaint of a certain\n",
       "wicked fairy that wasted the land wherein he dwelt, and wrought great\n",
       "damage to its inhabitants. And when he had ended the Queen set this task\n",
       "to me, unworthy as I am. Nor did I refuse to take it in hand. Now the\n",
       "name of this wicked fairy is Acrasia. Three times has the moon waxed and\n",
       "waned since that day, and I have already seen full proofs of the\n",
       "mischief which she works. To subdue her, therefore, and to bring her\n",
       "captive into the presence of Queen Gloriana is the purpose which I set\n",
       "before myself.”\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Many perils did Sir Guyon encounter, which it would take too long time\n",
       "to tell. Nor were there perils only of battle, such as befell in the\n",
       "meeting of pagan knights and the like. For such he was well prepared;\n",
       "never did sturdier champion lay spear in rest or wage war at close\n",
       "quarters with his sword. Force could not overcome him, but he could be\n",
       "led astray by fraud. So it was when, in his journeyings, he came to a\n",
       "broad water, which seemed to bar his way. While he stood at the water’s\n",
       "brink, wondering how he might win his way farther, suddenly there was\n",
       "seen hard by a little boat rowed by a fair damsel. When he had told his\n",
       "need she said: “Be content, fair sir; step you aboard and I will take\n",
       "you to the place which you desire.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So Sir Guyon, nothing doubting, stepped into the boat. But when he would\n",
       "have taken his guide, the pilgrim, with him, he was denied. “Nay, nay,”\n",
       "said the damsel, “we have not space for the old man on this journey.”\n",
       "And even while she was speaking the boat was already far from the land,\n",
       "for indeed it was a magic craft; nor could he even say farewell.\n",
       "\n",
       "The two had pleasant converse awhile, for the damsel was gay and\n",
       "debonair, and the knight courteous. Nevertheless, he somewhat misliked\n",
       "her manner, and when in a short space they came to the other side of the\n",
       "water, he perceived that he had been led astray, and was not a little\n",
       "displeased. “Lady,” said he, “you have done me a wrong. This is not the\n",
       "place which I sought; I did not think when I followed your bidding that\n",
       "you would so deceive me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Sir Knight,” she answered, “he that will travel by water cannot always\n",
       "command his way; winds and waves will not answer to his call: the sea is\n",
       "wide, and ’tis easy to go astray thereon. Yet here, methinks, you may\n",
       "abide awhile in peace.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So Sir Guyon stepped upon the shore, though he was but half-content to\n",
       "find himself in such a plight. Nevertheless, he could not but perceive\n",
       "that it was a right pleasant place to which he had come, for the ground\n",
       "was covered with flowers, and the trees were green with the fresh leaves\n",
       "of spring, and the sweet singing of birds was heard on every side. And\n",
       "fairer and more pleasant than all else was the damsel of the boat;\n",
       "nevertheless, Sir Guyon was ever on the watch, nor would he suffer\n",
       "himself to be beguiled. “Maybe,” he said to himself, “this fair dame\n",
       "designs to turn me from my quest. Why did she, as by design, part me\n",
       "from my guide? Why did she turn me aside from the way in which I desired\n",
       "to go? This was more, I doubt not, than an idle whim.” She, on the other\n",
       "hand, perceived that she had failed of her intent, and was, in truth, as\n",
       "willing that he should go as he was eager to depart. So after a while\n",
       "she said: “Fair knight, I perceive that it irks you to abide in this\n",
       "place. Suffer me, therefore, to carry you to the other shore.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Well content, he stepped into the boat, and was ferried across in the\n",
       "shortest space of time. So he passed through this peril, it seemed,\n",
       "without hurt, save indeed that he had lost his guide, for the damsel in\n",
       "her craft took him to a place far from where the guide had been left;\n",
       "and this losing of the guide was, as will be seen, a very sore hurt\n",
       "indeed.\n",
       "\n",
       "After a while he came to a gloomy valley covered in on all sides from\n",
       "the light of heaven with the thick branches of trees. And here, in the\n",
       "deepest and darkest shade, he saw sitting a man of a most uncouth and\n",
       "savage aspect, having his face all dark with smoke, and his eyes\n",
       "bleared, and the hair of his head and his beard covered with soot. His\n",
       "hands were black as the hands of one who works in a forge, and his nails\n",
       "were like to claws. He had an iron coat, all rusty above, but underneath\n",
       "of gold, and finely wrought with curious devices, though, indeed, it was\n",
       "covered with dust and grime. In his lap he had a mass of golden coin,\n",
       "which he counted, turning over each piece as if he would feed his eyes\n",
       "with the delight of seeing them. Round about him were great heaps of\n",
       "gold, some of them of rude ore, not yet smelted in the furnace, and some\n",
       "smelted newly, in great squares and ingots, and others in round plates\n",
       "without device; but for the most part they bore the devices of ancient\n",
       "kings and Cæsars. When the man beheld Sir Guyon he rose as in great\n",
       "fear, as if he would hide this precious store from a stranger’s eyes,\n",
       "and began to pour it into a great hole that was thereby. But Sir Guyon,\n",
       "leaping forward, caught him by the hand, and, though he was not a little\n",
       "dismayed by the things which he saw, restrained him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Man,” he said, “if, indeed, man you are, why sit you here apart, hiding\n",
       "these piles of wealth, and keeping them from being rightly used by men?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Truly,” answered the man, “you are bold and careless of yourself thus\n",
       "to trouble me. Know that I am the god of this world, the greatest god\n",
       "under heaven, Mammon by name. From me come riches and renown, powers and\n",
       "honours, and all things which men covet upon earth. Know, then, that if\n",
       "you will serve me, all these mountains of riches shall be yours; and if\n",
       "these do not content you, I will give you tenfold more.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Mammon,” answered the knight, “in vain do you boast your godhead; in\n",
       "vain do you offer me your gifts. Keep them for such as covet such idle\n",
       "things, and look for a more fitting servant. I am of those who regard\n",
       "honour and strive for kingdoms; fair shields and steeds gaily bedight\n",
       "and shining arms are pleasant to my eyes.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Do you not perceive,” answered Mammon, “O foolish knight, that money\n",
       "can furnish all these things in which you delight? Shields, and steeds,\n",
       "and arms it can provide in the twinkling of an eye; ay, and crowns and\n",
       "kingdoms also. I can throw down into the dust him that sits upon the\n",
       "throne, and I can lift up to the throne him that lies in the dust.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“But I,” said Sir Guyon, “have other thoughts of riches; that infinite\n",
       "mischiefs spring from them—strife and debate and bloodshed. No crowns\n",
       "nor kingdoms are yours, but you turn loyal truth to treason; you break\n",
       "the sacred diadem in pieces, and rend the purple robe of kingship. It is\n",
       "of you that castles are surprised, great cities sacked and burned, and\n",
       "kingdoms overthrown!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Mammon waxed wroth and cried: “Why, then, are men so eager to\n",
       "obtain a thing so evil? Why do they so complain when they have it not,\n",
       "and when they lose it, so upbraid?”\n",
       "\n",
       "And when the knight answered these questions by telling of how in the\n",
       "old time man was content without riches, and how he had been corrupted\n",
       "by the lust of gold and silver, Mammon replied: “Nay, my son, let be\n",
       "these stories of ancient days. You who live in these latter times must\n",
       "be content to take your wage for the work you do. Come now, you shall\n",
       "have what you will of these riches; and if you like them not, then you\n",
       "are free to refuse. Only, if you refuse, blame me not afterwards.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said the knight, for, being but mortal man, he was touched by the\n",
       "sight of great riches: “I would not take aught that is offered me unless\n",
       "I know that it has been rightly got. How can I be assured that you have\n",
       "not taken these things unlawfully from the rightful owner?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay,” cried Mammon, “that is but idle talk. Never did eye behold these\n",
       "things, never did hand handle them. I have kept them secret both from\n",
       "heaven and from earth.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“But,” said the knight, “what place is large enough to hold such store,\n",
       "or safe enough to keep it from robbery?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Come and see,” answered Mammon. And the knight followed him, but he had\n",
       "done more wisely to stay behind.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mammon led him through the depths of the wood, till they came to a\n",
       "secret way which was hollowed out in the earth. This they entered and\n",
       "followed awhile, till they came to where it opened out into a wide\n",
       "plain. Across the plain there was a broad highway which led to the\n",
       "dwelling of Pluto. On either side of this road were dreadful shapes—Pain\n",
       "holding an iron whip, and Strife with a bloody knife in his hand, and\n",
       "Revenge, and Treason, and Jealousy. Fear, also, was there, ever\n",
       "trembling, and seeking in vain where he might hide himself, and Sorrow,\n",
       "crouching in darkness, and Shame, hiding her face from every eye. So\n",
       "they came at last to a narrow door, which stood fast shut, with one\n",
       "which was yawning wide open hard by. The narrow door was the door of\n",
       "riches, and the wide the door of hell. This opened to Mammon of its own\n",
       "accord; and Sir Guyon followed him, fearing nothing. But behind the\n",
       "knight there followed close a monstrous fiend, watching him, that he\n",
       "might do him to death if he should lay a covetous hand or cast a longing\n",
       "eye on anything he might see; for such was the law of the place. The\n",
       "walls and the floor and the roof were all gold, but covered with dust\n",
       "and decay; and piled up on every side were huge chests of iron, bound\n",
       "all of them with double bands, and on the floor were the bones of dead\n",
       "men, who, in time past, had sought to win some spoil for themselves, and\n",
       "so had come by their death. But not a word did Sir Guyon speak. So they\n",
       "came to a great door of iron; this, too, opened to them as of its own\n",
       "accord, and showed such a store of wealth as could not be seen in all\n",
       "the world beside. Then Mammon turned to the knight and said: “See now\n",
       "the happiness of the world; here is that for which men strive and\n",
       "struggle. Lo! I lay before you all that you can desire.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The knight answered: “I do refuse your proffered grace. I seek not to be\n",
       "made happy in such fashion. I set before mine eyes another happiness. I\n",
       "seek another end; I would spend my life in brave deeds. I desire rather\n",
       "to be lord of them who have riches than to have them for myself.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Mammon gnashed his teeth to hear such an answer, for he had thought that\n",
       "the sight would overcome the soul of any mortal man, and that being so\n",
       "overcome the knight would be his prey. But not yet did he give up all\n",
       "hope. He led him into yet another chamber, in which were a hundred\n",
       "furnaces all ablaze, and at every furnace strange creatures busy at\n",
       "work. Some worked the bellows which raised the fire to white heat; and\n",
       "some scummed off the dross from the molten gold, and some stirred it\n",
       "with great ladles. But when they saw the shape of mortal man, they all\n",
       "ceased from their work, and looked at him with wondering eyes. And he\n",
       "was not a little dismayed to see them, so foul and hideous were they to\n",
       "behold.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Mammon spoke again: “See now what mortal eye has never seen before.\n",
       "You would know whence come the riches which men so fervently desire.\n",
       "Look, here you see their source and origin. Here is the fountain of the\n",
       "world’s whole wealth. Think, and change your mood, lest haply hereafter\n",
       "you may wish and not be able to obtain.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Said the knight, “Mammon, once more I refuse the thing which you offer.\n",
       "I have all that I need; why should I ask for more? Suffer me to follow\n",
       "my own way.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Great was Mammon’s wrath to hear his offers so refused, but he would try\n",
       "yet another temptation. He took the Knight into a very lofty, spacious\n",
       "chamber in which was assembled a great company of people from every\n",
       "nation under heaven. All of them were pressing forward with great uproar\n",
       "to the chamber’s upper end, where, upon a dais, was set a lofty throne.\n",
       "On the throne there sat a woman gorgeously attired, clad in such royal\n",
       "robes as never were worn by earthly prince. Right fair of face was she\n",
       "to behold, of such a beauty that she seemed, as it were, to make a\n",
       "brightness in the chamber. But the beauty was not indeed her own. It was\n",
       "but a pretence, cunningly devised to delude the hearts of men. In her\n",
       "hand she held a great chain, of which the upper end was fastened to the\n",
       "sky, and the lower went down into hell. All the crowd that thronged\n",
       "about her sought to lay hold of this same chain, hoping thereby to climb\n",
       "to some high estate. Some were fain to rise by the help of riches, and\n",
       "some by flattery, and some by help of friendship, but all thought only\n",
       "of themselves. And they that were high kept others down, and they that\n",
       "were low would not suffer others to rise; every man was against his\n",
       "fellow.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said Sir Guyon: “What means this that I see? What is this throng\n",
       "that crowds about the lady’s throne? And the lady, who is she?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Mammon answered: “That fair lady about whom these people crowd is my own\n",
       "dear daughter. Her name is Philotime (which, being interpreted, is Love\n",
       "of Honour). She is the fairest woman on the earth, could you but see her\n",
       "in the upper air, for the darkness of the place hides her beauty. Her,\n",
       "if you will, you shall have to wife, that she may advance you to high\n",
       "dignity.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I thank you, sir,” said the knight, “for the honour which you design\n",
       "for me. But I am only mortal man, and not fit match for an immortal\n",
       "mate. And were it otherwise, my troth is given to another, and it would\n",
       "ill become a loyal knight to break his faith.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Again was Mammon greatly moved to wrath, but he hid it in his heart, and\n",
       "led the knight into a garden full of herbs and trees, not such as earth\n",
       "puts forth, in the upper air, to delight the souls of men: but such as\n",
       "have about them the atmosphere of death. The cypress was there, and the\n",
       "black ebony, and hemlock, which unjust Athens gave in old times to\n",
       "Socrates, wisest of mortal men. These were gloomy to behold. But in the\n",
       "midst was a tree, splendid with apples of gold. Hercules planted it with\n",
       "the apples which he won from the garden of the daughters of Atlas, and\n",
       "it bore fruits which were the occasions of strife, such as that which\n",
       "Discord threw among the guests at the marriage-feast of Peleus and\n",
       "Thetis. “For the Fairest!” was written on it. Hence came the strife of\n",
       "the goddesses, and the Judgment of Paris, and the stealing of Helen, and\n",
       "the bringing to the ground of the towers of Troy.\n",
       "\n",
       "Much did the knight marvel to see the tree, for it spread its branches\n",
       "far and wide across the garden, and even beyond the garden’s bounds; for\n",
       "it was compassed about with a great mound. And the knight, desiring to\n",
       "see all that could be seen of so strange a place, climbed upon the bank\n",
       "and looked. And lo! there flowed below it a dark and dismal stream,\n",
       "which men call the River of Wailing. In this he saw many miserable\n",
       "creatures; and one he noted especially, who was always clutching at the\n",
       "fruit which hung from the tree, and making as though he would drink from\n",
       "the stream; and still the fruit seemed to draw back from his hand and\n",
       "the water from his mouth. The knight, seeing him so tormented, asked him\n",
       "who he was and how he came to be in such a plight.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I am Tantalus,” answered the wretch, “the most miserable of all men; in\n",
       "old time I feasted with the gods, and now I die of hunger and thirst.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Looking a little further he saw one who sought to wash in the stream\n",
       "hands covered with filth; but for all that he washed they were not one\n",
       "whit the cleaner. And when the knight inquired of him who he might be,\n",
       "he answered: “I am Pontius Pilate, most unjust of judges. I condemned\n",
       "most unrighteously the Lord of Life to die, and washed my hands to show\n",
       "that I was innocent of his blood, but in truth I was most guilty.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Mammon, coming to him again, said: “Will you not even now take of\n",
       "the good things which I offer you, for yet there is time?”\n",
       "\n",
       "But Sir Guyon was aware of his guile, and would not. “Take me back,” he\n",
       "said, “to the place from which I came,” and Mammon was constrained to\n",
       "obey, for it was not permitted to him to keep the knight or any man\n",
       "against his will. He led him back, therefore, to the upper air; but as\n",
       "soon as Sir Guyon felt the wind blow upon his face, for want of food and\n",
       "sleep he fell into a swoon, and lay without sense upon the ground.\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "While Sir Guyon was beholding the wonders of the house of Mammon, his\n",
       "faithful guide, the pilgrim, was seeking him, and came by happy chance,\n",
       "or leading of the powers above, to the place where he lay. Sore troubled\n",
       "he was to see him in so sore a plight, for indeed he lay as one that was\n",
       "dead. Nevertheless, feeling his pulse with trembling hand, the pilgrim\n",
       "found that it still did beat. Thereat greatly rejoicing he tended him\n",
       "with all care and kindness.\n",
       "\n",
       "While he was busy with this tending, he lifted his eyes and saw two\n",
       "knights riding towards him clad in bright armour and an old man pacing\n",
       "by their side. The two were brothers, Pyrochles and Cymochles by name,\n",
       "and the old man was Archimage. Well he knew who they were, for Sir Guyon\n",
       "had done battle with the two in the time past, and had vanquished them,\n",
       "nor did he doubt that the old man, for all his reverend looks, was a\n",
       "wicked sorcerer. And they, too, knew who he was, and that the knight who\n",
       "lay upon the ground was their whilom adversary, Sir Guyon. And first Sir\n",
       "Pyrochles cried aloud: “Old man, leave that dead man to us. A traitor\n",
       "and a coward he was, while he was yet alive; and now he lies\n",
       "dishonoured!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay, Sir Knight,” answered the pilgrim, “you do wrong so to revile the\n",
       "dead. He was a true knight and valiant in the field, as none know more\n",
       "surely than yourself.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said the other pagan, Cymochles: “Old man, you dote. And, indeed,\n",
       "what know you of knighthood and valour? All is not gold that glitters;\n",
       "nor are all good knights that know how to set spear in rest and use the\n",
       "sword. Let a man be judged by his end. There he lies dead on the field,\n",
       "and the dead are nothing worth.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Pyrochles spoke again: “Ay, he is dead and I must forego the vengeance\n",
       "that I vowed to have upon him. Nevertheless, what I can that will I\n",
       "have. I will despoil him of his arms. Why should a dead body be arrayed\n",
       "in so noble a fashion?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay, Sir Knight,” cried the pilgrim, “I pray you not to do so foul a\n",
       "deed. ’Tis a vile thing to rob the dead. Surely it would better befit a\n",
       "noble knight to leave these things to be the ornament of his tomb.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What tomb?” cried Pyrochles, in his rage; “the raven and the kite are\n",
       "tomb enough for such as he.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus speaking, he laid a rude hand upon Sir Guyon’s shield, and\n",
       "Cymochles began to unlace his helmet. But while they were so busied,\n",
       "they chanced to spy a knight of gallant mien and bravely accoutred,\n",
       "riding towards them, with a squire behind him, who carried a spear of\n",
       "ebony and a covered shield. And Archimage, so cunning was he, knew him\n",
       "from afar, and he cried to the two brothers: “Rise, prepare yourselves\n",
       "for battle. Here comes the sturdiest knight in all the world, Prince\n",
       "Arthur. Many a pagan has he laid low in battle. You must use all your\n",
       "skill to hold your own against him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So the two made themselves ready for battle. And now the strange knight\n",
       "rode up, and with all courtesy made his salute to the company, to which\n",
       "greeting the two brothers made but a churlish return. He said to the\n",
       "pilgrim: “Tell me, reverend sir, what misfortune has befallen this\n",
       "knight. Did he die in course of nature, or by treason, or in fair\n",
       "fight?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Said the pilgrim: “He is not dead, but in a swoon that has the likeness\n",
       "of death.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Prince Arthur, turning to the two brothers, said with all courtesy:\n",
       "“Valiant sirs, who, I doubt not, have just complaint against this\n",
       "knight, who lies here dead, or seeming dead upon the ground, will you\n",
       "not abate your wrath awhile? I would not challenge your right, but would\n",
       "rather entreat your pardon for this helpless body.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“But who are you?” said Cymochles, “that make yourself his daysman? Who\n",
       "are you that would hinder me from wreaking on his vile carcase the\n",
       "vengeance which I should have required had he lived? The man is dead,\n",
       "but his offence still lives.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“It is but true,” said the Prince, “that evil lives after death, and\n",
       "that the curse goes down even to the third and fourth generation, so\n",
       "stern is the judgment of God. But yet the knight who raises his hand\n",
       "against the dead, sins against his honour.”\n",
       "\n",
       "But Pyrochles made reply: “Stranger, you make yourself a sharer in the\n",
       "dead man’s crime.” And as he spoke, he lifted his great sword and dealt\n",
       "a blow which, but that the Prince’s horse swerved aside, had surely laid\n",
       "him on the earth. He reeled somewhat in the saddle, but so true was his\n",
       "seat, still kept his place.\n",
       "\n",
       "Great was his wrath at such treacherous attack. “Traitor,” he said, “you\n",
       "have broken the law of arms, so to strike without challenge given, and\n",
       "you shall suffer such penalty as befits.” So speaking, he thrust his\n",
       "spear, and thought with that one thrust to end the battle. And so,\n",
       "indeed, it would have fallen out, but for Sir Guyon’s shield, which the\n",
       "pagan carried. Yet even through this, with its seven folds, did the\n",
       "spear-head pass, and pierced Pyrochles’ shoulder, and drove him bleeding\n",
       "to the earth.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Cymochles saw what had happened, he leapt forward in great wrath,\n",
       "crying: “Now, by Mahomet, cursed thief! You shall pay for this blow!”\n",
       "and smote him on the crest so mightily that he had no chance but to\n",
       "leave his saddle, else had his head been cleft in twain. Now was the\n",
       "Prince in no small distress, for what could he do with his spear alone\n",
       "against two stalwart knights? For sword he had none, and they too were\n",
       "both fully armed, and well skilled in fight, unwounded one, and the\n",
       "other wounded indeed, but only made thereby more furious. Bravely did he\n",
       "bear himself, and bravely held his own, wounding now this adversary and\n",
       "now that, yet did not himself escape without hurt, for Cymochles wounded\n",
       "him sorely in the side, so that the blood flowed out amain. And when the\n",
       "brothers saw it, they rejoiced greatly, thinking that the end had come.\n",
       "But now the pilgrim, seeing that the Prince was hard bested, and all for\n",
       "want of a sword, came near and put Sir Guyon’s blade into his hand,\n",
       "saying, “My son, God bless your right hand; use the sword as he that\n",
       "owns it would have used!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Right glad was the knight to have this help, and advanced himself with\n",
       "new courage to his task. He smote first this brother and then that, and\n",
       "both so fiercely that, though they were two against one, they could not\n",
       "hold their own, but began to give way. Only the Prince was at this\n",
       "disadvantage that, when Pyrochles held out against him the shield of Sir\n",
       "Guyon with the likeness of Queen Gloriana on it, his hand retreated and\n",
       "forebore the stroke. Once and again was the pagan saved thereby from\n",
       "instant doom. But for all that the appointed hour drew nigh. Cymochles,\n",
       "thinking to end the battle, smote the Prince upon the hauberk. So fierce\n",
       "was the blow, that it broke the links of the mail in twain, and made the\n",
       "Prince to reel, as he had never reeled before. But his courage rose all\n",
       "the higher, and his strength seemed to be doubled. High in the air he\n",
       "lifted Sir Guyon’s sword, and smote the pagan’s helmet so fiercely that\n",
       "he shore it in two, and the steel pierced to the brain, so that he fell\n",
       "dying to the ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Pyrochles beheld what had befallen his brother, he was so filled\n",
       "with rage that he cast away all caution and care, and rushed in madman’s\n",
       "fashion upon the Prince. And now might be seen how an evil deed finds\n",
       "its recompense. The sword which the pagan carried was, in truth, the\n",
       "Prince’s own, which had been filched from him by craft. Now Archimage\n",
       "had warned the knight before, saying: “Use not this blade against its\n",
       "rightful lord; it will not serve your will.” And well he knew that he\n",
       "spoke the truth. But Pyrochles had laughed him to scorn, saying:\n",
       "\n",
       "“You think too much, old man, of magic charms and words.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Yet now he found that the old man’s words were true. So perceiving that\n",

       "Prince, and caught him round the middle and thought to throw him to the\n",
       "earth. But he strove to no purpose, for the Prince surpassed him both in\n",
       "strength and in skill, so that he was thrown to the ground, whereon he\n",
       "lay helpless as a bittern in the claws of an eagle. Full of rage he was,\n",
       "but he did not move nor cast a look upon his conqueror. But the Prince,\n",
       "full of courtesy and kindness, said: “Pagan, this is an evil day for\n",

       "my liegeman for ever, I will give you life in reward for your courage,\n",

       "Prince, much against his will, smote him that he died.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now Sir Guyon, waking from his swoon, saw the pilgrim at his side,\n",

       "wandered long, how gladly do I see you again. But where are my shield\n",
       "and my sword?” Then the pilgrim told him what had befallen, and the\n",

       "All day the two journeyed together with much sweet converse, and, when\n",
       "it was evening, they came to a fair castle, of which the gate was fast\n",
       "barred. So the Prince bade his squire wind his horn under the castle\n",
       "wall, which thing he did with such a will, that a watchman straightway\n",
       "looked forth from an upper storey; but the gate was barred as before.\n",
       "“What want you, strangers?” he asked.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "“Fly,” cried the man, “fly, my friends, for your lives. Willingly would\n",

       "fiercely do our enemies assail us. Truly many knights, coming as you\n",
       "have come this day, have perished miserably.” And while he was speaking\n",
       "a thousand villainous creatures swarmed up from all the rocks and caves\n",
       "about, armed in the strangest fashion, some with pikes, and some with\n",
       "clubs, and some with stakes hardened in the fire. Fiercely they rushed\n",
       "at the knights and their company, and for a while drove them back by\n",
       "mere force of numbers. But soon they were forced to fly, and though they\n",
       "came again and again, yet before the night fell they departed and left\n",
       "the travellers in peace. And now the castle gate was opened wide, and\n",
       "the lady of the place, Alma by name, coming to the door with a fair\n",
       "company of knights and dames, bade them welcome. Then she showed them\n",
       "her castle, which was marvellously well-ordered in all its parts. There\n",
       "was a noble hall in which the guests—and there was already gathered a\n",
       "goodly company of knights and ladies—were entertained; and a library\n",
       "where there was a great store of goodly books, and all other things\n",
       "which the heart of man could desire.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the morrow, Sir Guyon and his guide set forth again, but Prince\n",
       "Arthur tarried behind, desiring to help the Lady Alma against the\n",
       "enemies who sought to take her castle. And this he did in such a fashion\n",
       "that she was troubled no more with them. Yet of his great deeds I will\n",
       "not further speak, being rather concerned with the doings of Sir Guyon,\n",
       "who was indeed now come to the accomplishment of his task.\n",
       "\n",
       "First they came to a great water, where there was a ferry-boat ready\n",
       "prepared for their coming. In this they embarked and set forth, a stout\n",
       "ferryman being at hand to manage the craft. Two days they sailed and saw\n",
       "no land; but on the third day, as the light began to dawn in the East,\n",
       "they heard the sound of a great roaring. Now the pilgrim held the tiller\n",
       "and steered the craft. To him said the ferryman: “Pilgrim, steer an even\n",
       "course; there is a dangerous place which we must pass across,—on the one\n",
       "side is a great whirlpool, and a ship that comes too near it is sure to\n",
       "sink, and on the other a great rock of magnet, which, if we keep not a\n",
       "due distance, will draw us to itself. Steer then so that we may not fall\n",
       "into this danger or into that.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Right skilfully did the pilgrim steer, and great was the need. The\n",
       "whirlpool, indeed, showed no sign of what had happened there before, for\n",
       "all was swallowed up in its depths; but on the rock they saw the ribs of\n",
       "ships which had been broken upon it, and the bones of men lying in its\n",
       "clefts. And birds of prey, mews and cormorants and the like, sat\n",
       "watching for such spoils as should come. Right willingly did they pass\n",
       "from that place of death. And when the ferryman, plying his oars with\n",
       "sturdy strength, had rowed awhile, Sir Guyon cried, pointing with his\n",
       "hand: “I see land yonder; steer thereto, good sir.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay,” said the ferryman, “it is not so. That is no land which you see,\n",
       "but what men call the Wandering Islands. Many men have come to their\n",
       "deaths through them. They seem firm ground, fairly grown with trees and\n",
       "grass and flowers; but let a man once set his foot upon them, he can\n",
       "never recover it again.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So they journeyed on in a straight course, and in so doing came to one\n",
       "of these islands, whereon they espied a fair lady sitting. On the rock\n",
       "she sat, and she had a little boat hard by. “Come hither, my friends,”\n",
       "she said. “I have somewhat here which I would show you, and which you\n",
       "would willingly see.”\n",
       "\n",
       "But Sir Guyon said: “Nay, nay. We are otherwise minded; this is the Lady\n",
       "of the Lake who caused me to be parted from my guide.” So they passed\n",
       "on, and took no heed. But when, after a while, they passed hard by\n",
       "another island, on which sat a maiden in sore distress, as it seemed,\n",
       "Sir Guyon’s heart was moved; for was it not a good knight’s part to\n",
       "succour ladies in distress? “Steer thither,” he cried.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Not so. This damsel in distress is but a show; no damsel she, but some\n",
       "ill creature ready to devour any that she may deceive.” So they passed\n",
       "on, nor did they halt when, passing by a pleasant bay, they heard a\n",
       "sound of sweet singing.\n",
       "\n",
       "“O Guyon,” such was the song which they heard, “flower of chivalry, most\n",
       "famous of all knights upon earth, turn thy bark hither, and rest\n",
       "awhile.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Listen not,” said the pilgrim, “they do but seek to lure you to your\n",
       "death.”\n",
       "\n",
       "These things past, they came to the place for which they were bound. And\n",
       "the pilgrim said: “This, Sir Knight, is the place where you must contend\n",
       "for the mastery. Take your arms, and make yourself ready, for the hour\n",
       "of trial is at hand.”\n",
       "\n",
       "And now the ferryman drove the boat upon the shore, and Sir Guyon and\n",
       "his guide stepped out upon the sand. Straightway they heard a hideous\n",
       "bellowing as of savage beasts, and soon the beasts themselves came in\n",
       "view, threatening as if they would devour them. But no sooner did the\n",
       "pilgrim hold out his staff than they ceased their roaring, and humbled\n",
       "themselves to the ground. And now they came to the Bower of Bliss, a\n",
       "place most daintily adorned with all that could please the eye. The\n",
       "porch by which they entered was of ivory cunningly adorned with carved\n",
       "work, in which was told the story of Jason and Medea; how he sailed in\n",
       "the good ship _Argo_, and how he won the love of the king’s daughter,\n",
       "and how she helped him to win the fleece of gold from the dragon which\n",
       "guarded it, and how she fled with him over the sea. And when they had\n",
       "passed through the porch they came to a very fair meadow, adorned with\n",
       "the fairest trees and flowers. And the meadow being passed they came to\n",
       "another gate, where there sat a comely damsel, who pressed the clusters\n",
       "of a vine which hung above her head into a cup. This cup she proffered\n",
       "to the knight, and he, suspecting evil in all that seemed most fair and\n",
       "pleasant, took it from her hand, and threw it violently on the ground,\n",
       "so that it was broken into many pieces, and all the liquor was spilt.\n",
       "\n",
       "[Illustration: Sir Guyon and the Men in Bestial Shapes.]\n",
       "\n",
       "Many other tempting sights did they see, and all the knight passed by\n",
       "unscathed, the pilgrim not ceasing on occasion to give counsel and\n",
       "warning. So at last they came to the most sacred place of the Bower,\n",
       "where the queen herself, Acrasia by name, had her abode. Fair she was\n",
       "beyond all words and daintily arrayed, and at her feet there lay a\n",
       "goodly knight asleep. He was of goodly aspect, just come to the years of\n",
       "manhood, with the down newly sprung upon his cheeks and his lips. His\n",
       "arms hung idly on a tree hard by, but his shield was without an emblem,\n",
       "as if he had put away the purpose of his life.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Guyon and the pilgrim drew near, none seeming to heed them, so\n",
       "occupied were they with the pleasures of the place. And then the pilgrim\n",
       "threw over the queen and the knight a net which he had cunningly\n",
       "prepared for that same purpose. Fast did it hold them for all their\n",
       "struggles, neither force nor art could avail them, though they strove\n",
       "with all their might. The queen being thus captured, they bound her with\n",
       "chains of adamant, for nothing else could hold her safely; but the\n",
       "knight they soon set free, for he was of a noble nature, though it was\n",
       "much decayed by evil ways, and he was willing to take to himself good\n",
       "advice and counsel. And the beauty and glory of the Bower did they\n",
       "deface and spoil, the goodly carvings they broke in pieces, and cut down\n",
       "the pleasant groves. As for the beasts, when the pilgrim raised his\n",
       "staff over them, they left their bestial shapes and came back to their\n",
       "own, for, indeed, they were men whom this same evil queen had changed to\n",

       "they did, helping the weak and setting right the things that were wrong.\n",
       "It happened on a certain day that they espied a knight riding towards\n",
       "them, with an aged squire by his side, who seemed too weak for the\n",
       "burden which he bare. The knight had a shield with the device of a lion\n",

       "onset, was like to pierce the stranger’s shield, but this it did not\n",
       "avail to do, nor did it drive the stranger from his seat: nevertheless\n",
       "he was somewhat shaken. On the other hand, Sir Guyon himself was carried\n",
       "back, ere he was aware, nigh upon a spear’s length behind the crupper of\n",
       "his saddle, yet without hurt to life or limb. Nevertheless his anger was\n",
       "great, for never since the day when he first bore arms as a knight had\n",
       "he been dismounted in such fashion. And indeed, if he had known the\n",
       "whole truth of the matter, his anger had been both less and greater;\n",
       "less because the spear by which he had been overthrown was of the magic\n",
       "sort, and greater, because the knight by whom he had been overthrown was\n",
       "no man, but a maid, even the famous Britomart. Full of rage he was and\n",
       "hot to do away his disgrace, as leaping from the ground he drew his\n",
       "sword. And now the pilgrim in great haste came between the knight and\n",
       "his purpose, for being a holy man and wise, he perceived that there was\n",
       "some marvellous power in that same spear-point. This indeed he did not\n",
       "disclose, for it was not lawful so to do, but he made other pretence:\n",
       "“Nay, Sir Knight, it were ill advised to seek amends with your sword for\n",
       "the mischance of your spear. If haply your steed swerved somewhat to the\n",
       "side, or your page was somewhat careless in the ordering of your\n",
       "equipage, why should you be so carried away by wrath; for, remember, you\n",

       "\n",
       "When they had journeyed awhile Prince Arthur and Sir Guyon set off on an\n",
       "adventure of their own, to rescue some fair lady in distress. But\n",
       "Britomart, finding that they two would suffice for that enterprise, on\n",
       "which her own mind was in nowise set, rode on without company until she\n",
       "came to a fair castle, with a meadow before the gate, on which she saw\n",
       "six knights setting upon one. He was not a little pressed by such odds,\n",
       "yet in nowise dismayed. Indeed, the six dared not to stand up against\n",
       "him face to face, so shrewd were the blows which he dealt them, but\n",
       "sought to take him at a disadvantage from behind. Britomart endured not\n",
       "to see such knavish work, but setting spurs to her horse and crying\n",
       "aloud, “Have done with such foul tricks,” made all haste to help. And\n",
       "when they ceased awhile from the attack, she said to the single knight:\n",
       "“How comes it, sir, that you do battle in such fashion and at such\n",
       "odds?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Sir,” he made answer, “these six would have me swear that the lady of\n",
       "this castle hard by is fairer than the lady whom I love. Now that I\n",
       "utterly refuse; I had sooner die than break my plighted word in such a\n",
       "fashion.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said one of the six, speaking for his fellows: “In this castle\n",
       "which you see there dwells a lady of such a beauty that none in all the\n",
       "world can be compared with her. She has ordained this law, that any\n",
       "knight coming to this place, if he have no lady-love already, shall vow\n",
       "himself to her service; but if he have such a lady-love, then he shall\n",
       "confess that she is of less grace and beauty, or failing so to do, shall\n",
       "do battle with us.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“By heaven!” cried Britomart, “this is a hard choice! And tell me, pray,\n",
       "if this knight be obedient to this same law, what reward shall he have?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“He shall have the lady’s fair regard. But tell us, sir, for\n",
       "yourself—have you a lady-love?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“That,” said Britomart, “I answer not; whether I have such or have not,\n",
       "I pay no such homage as you ask to your lady. Rather, I take up this\n",
       "good knight’s cause against you.” And even while she spoke, she rode at\n",
       "one of the six and laid him low upon the ground, and then at another,\n",
       "and then again at a third, with the like end. Meanwhile the knight had\n",
       "discomfited the fourth. And the two that were left were fain to sue for\n",
       "peace. “See,” said Britomart, “how truth and honour prevail!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then was Britomart taken into the castle and received with great honour.\n",
       "Yet she misliked the place and the company, for that they both seemed\n",
       "unduly given over to ease and luxury. Nor would she doff her armour,\n",
       "nor, indeed, do aught but raise the visor of her helmet. And when the\n",
       "lady of the place, seeing that the stranger was very fair and of a noble\n",
       "presence, bore herself as one greatly enamoured, she departed in great\n",
       "discontent. The six knights would fain have stopped her going, and one\n",
       "of them, Gardanté by name, shooting with an arrow, for to come to closer\n",
       "quarters was not to his mind, wounded her in the side. But he and his\n",
       "companions received manifold more hurt than they gave, not only from\n",
       "Britomart, but from the strange knight and Sir Guyon also, for they,\n",
       "hearing the tumult, came to her help.\n",
       "\n",
       "As they journeyed, it came into Sir Guyon’s mind to inquire of his\n",
       "companion concerning her condition, and how she came to be wandering in\n",
       "these parts. Britomart was not a little disturbed by this questioning.\n",
       "For a while she was silent, and could make no answer, but trembled and\n",
       "blushed, no knight but a very woman. But when the passion had passed,\n",
       "and she had gathered her strength together, she said: “Sir Knight, I\n",
       "would have you know that from a child I have been trained in things of\n",
       "war, to carry a shield, and to put spear in rest, that the life of ease,\n",
       "which women, for the most part, follow, pleased me not; and as for\n",
       "fingering the fine needle and the slender thread, by heaven! I had\n",
       "sooner be struck dead by a foeman’s spear! And so, all my heart being\n",
       "set on deeds of arms and perilous adventures, by sea and by land,\n",
       "wheresoever they might be met, I came from my own country, which men\n",
       "call the Greater Britain, into this land. For it was told me that in\n",
       "this same fairy land many such adventures were to be found, and much\n",
       "glory and honour won thereupon. And now, courteous sir, I would ask you\n",
       "one question: Know you, perchance, of one Artegall, for he has done me a\n",
       "wrong for which I would fain requite him?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Scarcely had she spoken the words, when she fain would have called them\n",
       "back. But Sir Guyon, taking them up with no small heat, made answer:\n",
       "“Fair warrior, surely you do ill to accuse so true and loyal a knight as\n",
       "is Sir Artegall with ill-behaviour. Truly of all who have ever taken\n",
       "part in tilt or tourney, there is not one that stands in better repute\n",
       "than he. It were indeed the greatest of marvels that he should do an\n",
       "unworthy act, or even think in his heart an unworthy thought. And if you\n",
       "have come with such a purpose in your heart, then I say that you have\n",
       "journeyed far on a false errand.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Now Britomart, in her secret heart, was glad to hear such praises of Sir\n",
       "Artegall. For, indeed, as will be seen, she loved him, and it was her\n",
       "woman’s craft, by speaking ill of him to his friends, so to call forth\n",
       "his praises. And when, with this thought in her heart, she had again\n",
       "uttered some injurious words concerning him, Sir Guyon answered: “It\n",
       "would be well, lady, that you should listen to reason in this matter.\n",
       "Truly he is not one whom you can compel by force to do this thing or\n",
       "that, for there is not, I take it, a knight upon earth that can match\n",
       "him in equal fight. And, indeed, for what you ask me, where is Sir\n",
       "Artegall to be found, I cannot tell you. He is not one who will remain\n",
       "for long time in any certain place; rather he wanders round the world,\n",
       "seeking occasion for great deeds, by which he can help to right such as\n",
       "suffer wrong.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Britomart was greatly pleased to hear such praises of the knight. Still\n",
       "she dissembled the matter and said: “Whether it be easy or hard to find\n",
       "the man I know not; but at least I would know how I may profitably seek\n",
       "him. Tell me some mark by which I may know him, the manner of his\n",
       "shield, the fashion of his arms, the bearing of his steed, and other\n",
       "things by which I may certainly know the man should I chance to\n",
       "encounter him.” Then Sir Guyon told her all that she would know, and\n",

       "                        OF MERLIN’S MAGIC MIRROR\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "There was a certain king of old time in the land of Deheubarth, which\n",
       "men now call South Wales. His name was Ryence, and he had for his\n",
       "principal counsellor one Merlin, who was a great magician. This Merlin\n",
       "made by his art a wonderful mirror, which was so contrived that he who\n",
       "looked in it could see anything from the lowest parts of the earth to\n",
       "the highest part of the heavens, if only it concerned him. If a foe\n",
       "contrived any evil against him, if a friend had used any falsehood in\n",
       "respect of him, there he could see it plainly set forth. This mirror\n",
       "Merlin gave to the king for a protection, that if at any time an enemy\n",
       "should invade his dominions, he should know of his design before tidings\n",
       "could come to him from without, and so should be able to be beforehand\n",
       "with him. Never had prince a more noble present, nor one more worthy of\n",
       "reward, for there could be no treason within the realm or enmity without\n",
       "but that it came straightway to the king’s knowledge.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now Britomart was the daughter of King Ryence, and it chanced on a\n",
       "certain day that she came into his closet, for he kept nothing secret\n",
       "from her, seeing that she was his only child and the heir of his\n",
       "kingdom, and there saw Merlin’s mirror. She had seen it indeed not once\n",
       "or twice only, and knew its virtues. There came into her head the\n",
       "thought that she might see therein the image of the man who should be\n",
       "her husband. Such a thought maidens are wont to entertain, and\n",
       "Britomart, being her father’s only child, and knowing that she would one\n",
       "day come to the kingdom, was the more curious in this regard, nor had\n",
       "she had to that time any thought of one man more than of another. So\n",
       "looking into the mirror she saw a very comely knight, armed cap-à-pie.\n",
       "He had the visor of his helmet up, showing a face that would strike fear\n",
       "into an enemy and be loving to a friend. He was tall of stature, and\n",
       "bore himself with a manly grace. For his crest he had a hound couchant,\n",
       "and his armour seemed of ancient fashion, massive and strong to look at;\n",
       "on it was written in old letters these words, “The Arms of Achilles\n",
       "which Artegall did win.” The shield was of seven folds, and it bore an\n",
       "ermilin crowned, white on a field of blue. The maiden looked and liked\n",
       "well what she saw, and went her way, not knowing—such was the simplicity\n",
       "of her age—that she had seen with her eyes the fate that should rule the\n",
       "fortunes of her life. That keen archer Love had wounded her with his\n",
       "arrow, but she knew it not. Yet from that day she began to droop. No\n",
       "longer did she carry herself with princely pride. Sad and solemn was\n",
       "she, and full of fancies, yet knew not why. That she ailed somewhat she\n",
       "was well aware, but thought it was not love, but some passing mood of\n",
       "melancholy. Such was she by day, and at night, when she laid herself\n",
       "down to rest, sleep fled far from her eyes. She kept a sorrowful watch\n",
       "as the hours of the night went by, and she watered her couch with her\n",
       "tears; and if, when nature was worn out with these long watchings, she\n",
       "fell into some brief slumber, then some fearful dreams would come and\n",
       "bring with them a worse unrest.\n",
       "\n",
       "One night her nurse, Glaucé by name, caught her in her arms as she was\n",
       "leaping from her bed, and held her down by force. “Ah, my child,” she\n",
       "cried, “how is it that you are in this evil plight? What is it that has\n",
       "changed your cheerful mood to this sadness? Surely there is some cause\n",
       "for these troubles that haunt you by night, and drive away sleep from\n",
       "your eyes. And in the days when your equals in age disport themselves,\n",
       "you mope in solitary corners, and have no enjoyment of your princely\n",
       "life. I doubt much whether the cause be not love; yet if the love be\n",
       "worthy of your race and royal birth—and that it is I seem to myself to\n",
       "read by many signs and tokens—then I do swear most solemnly to help you.\n",
       "Away, dear child, with your fears! Neither danger or death shall keep me\n",
       "from bringing you due relief.” Then she caught the maid in her arms, and\n",
       "embraced her in all tenderness, and chafed her limbs to drive away the\n",
       "cold, and kissed her eyes, still entreating that she should show the\n",
       "secret of her heart. For a while the maid was silent; then she said,\n",
       "“Dear nurse, why should you grieve for me? Is it not enough that I must\n",
       "die? Must you die also?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Talk not of dying,” cried the nurse; “never was wound yet for which no\n",
       "salve could be found. The god who has wounded you has, I doubt not, in\n",
       "his quiver another arrow for your lover’s heart.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So they talked together; the maid would have it that there was no remedy\n",
       "for her trouble; the old nurse still steadfastly affirmed that the cure\n",
       "could easily be found. At last the damsel told the secret of her grief,\n",
       "as it seemed to her: “Alas, dear mother,” she said, “it is no living man\n",
       "whose image dwells in my heart and makes this pain; it is but the shadow\n",
       "and semblance of a knight; I saw him one day in the magic mirror of the\n",
       "king my father; this is the baited hook which, as some foolish fish, I\n",
       "swallowed; it is this thought that brings me to my death.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Is this all, my daughter?” cried the nurse; “then is nothing strange or\n",
       "against nature here. Why should you not set your heart on one who seemed\n",
       "so worthy of your love?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, mother,” answered the girl, “I seemed to myself like the Greek boy\n",
       "of old who saw his own face in the fountain and perished miserably.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay,” cried the nurse, “he was but the lover of a shadow, and rightly\n",
       "faded into a flower. But of this image which you saw, there is, be sure,\n",
       "a substance somewhere, and there are arts by which it may be found. And\n",
       "now, dear child, let me give you my counsel. If you can banish this\n",
       "thought from your mind till the convenient time be come, then do so. If\n",
       "it is too strong for you, then I vow and promise that, by one means or\n",
       "another, I will find this very knight whose image you beheld.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The maid was somewhat encouraged by these words, and slept awhile. But\n",
       "on the morrow, and as the days went by, the old trouble came again, and\n",
       "Glaucé, seeing that neither words nor prayers, nor strange spells of the\n",
       "magic art, for such she tried, were of any avail, judged that some other\n",
       "remedy must needs be found. What this remedy might be she long doubted\n",
       "in herself. At last it seemed to her that he who had made the mirror,\n",
       "that is to say, the wise magician Merlin, might tell her in what land\n",
       "the knight of the image might dwell, for though he dwelt in farthest\n",
       "Ind, yet find him she would. Forthwith these two, that is to say, Glaucé\n",
       "and the maiden Britomart, disguised themselves in mean attire, that no\n",
       "one might learn their purpose, and betook themselves to Maridunum,\n",
       "where, in a cave which he had hollowed out for himself beneath the\n",
       "earth, so as to escape from the curious eyes of men, Merlin had his\n",
       "abode. When they were come to the place they stood awhile without, in\n",
       "doubt and fear, whether they had done well in making so bold a venture.\n",
       "\n",
       "At last the maid, moved by love, which is ever bold, led the way, and\n",
       "Glaucé following, they stood within the cave. There they found the\n",
       "magician busy on some wonderful work, for he was writing strange\n",
       "characters on the ground, the spells by which he bound the spirits of\n",
       "the earth to his service. He was not one whit moved at their coming, of\n",
       "which, indeed, he was aware beforehand, for indeed by his art he knew\n",
       "the secret thoughts of others. Nevertheless he made as though he knew\n",
       "not their errand, saying: “Tell me now on what business you are come?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Glaucé answered: “Blame us not, kind sir, that we have thus\n",
       "disturbed you in your solitude, coming thus unbidden, but the need was\n",
       "great.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Speak on,” said Merlin.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then she began: “Three months have passed since this maiden here began\n",
       "to sicken of some strange disease. What it is, and whence it began, I\n",
       "know not; only this I know, that unless you can find some remedy she\n",
       "must shortly die.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The magician smiled at her woman’s craft, knowing well that she had in\n",
       "her heart that which she would not tell. “Madam,” he said, “I take it\n",
       "from what you say that this damsel has more need of the physician’s art\n",
       "than of any skill of mine. They who may find a remedy for their trouble\n",
       "elsewhere, do ill to have recourse to the magic art.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The old dame was not a little disturbed by these words, but yet was\n",
       "loath to show her true purpose. “Sir,” she said, “the trouble has taken\n",
       "too strong a hold on this maiden’s life that the physician’s art could\n",
       "work a cure. I fear me much that some bad spell has been cast upon her.\n",
       "Some witch or evil spirit has done this thing; therefore it is that we\n",
       "seek your help.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When he heard these words Merlin could no more contain himself, but\n",
       "laughed aloud. “Glaucé,” he said, “what avails this pretence by which\n",
       "you seek to hide your purpose? And you, fair Britomart, why have you\n",
       "thus disguised yourself in mean attire, as the sun hides himself behind\n",
       "a cloud? You have come, by the ordering of Fate, to the very place where\n",
       "you shall find the help which you need.” The maiden, hearing her name so\n",
       "called, blushed a rosy red; but the nurse, not one whit dismayed, but\n",
       "rather taking heart at Merlin’s words, said:\n",
       "\n",
       "“Sir, if you know our troubles, and, indeed, what is there that you do\n",
       "not know, have pity upon us, and help us in our need.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Merlin sat silent awhile, for many thoughts were in his mind. At last he\n",
       "spoke: “Most noble maid, who have learned to love in this strange\n",
       "fashion, be not dismayed by this hard beginning of your life. It was no\n",
       "chance look, O Britomart, in the mirror of the king your father, but the\n",
       "unchanging course of the purposes of Heaven, that showed you this image.\n",
       "Believe me, it is no ill-fortune that you love this noble knight. Submit\n",
       "yourself, therefore, to the purposes of God, and be content to do His\n",
       "will.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said Glaucé: “Tell us, man of wisdom, what means she shall use,\n",
       "what ways she shall take, to find this man. Or has she no need of toil,\n",
       "but may sit still while her fate is fashioned for her?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“The fates,” answered Merlin, “are firmly fixed; not the less it becomes\n",
       "those whom they concern to do their own endeavour, and to be\n",
       "fellow-workers with God.” Then he told Britomart the true name and\n",
       "lineage of Sir Artegall, how that he was son to Gorloïs, King of\n",
       "Cornwall in time past, and brother to Cador, then king of the same land.\n",
       "Then he turned to Britomart and opened to her the future, how she should\n",
       "be wife to Sir Artegall, and how from them would come a line of kings\n",
       "who should reign with great glory. Many things that should come to pass\n",
       "in after days, both good and evil, did Merlin unfold to her.\n",

       "                       HOW BRITOMART TOOK TO ARMS\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "From Merlin’s cave these two, Britomart and Glaucé, her nurse, went back\n",
       "to their own home. There they consulted together many days how they\n",
       "might best carry out their purpose of seeking Sir Artegall. At last\n",
       "Glaucé said: “My daughter, I have conceived in my heart a scheme,\n",
       "somewhat bold, I must confess, yet such as may be accomplished if you\n",
       "are both brave and prudent. And above all things, it is in good accord\n",
       "with the conditions of these present days. You must know that the good\n",
       "King Uther has of late made war against the pagan brothers, Octa and\n",
       "Oza, who are newly come to this country from the lands which lie about\n",
       "the Northern Sea, and has won a great victory over them and their\n",
       "people, and that all Britain is now in a great flame of war. My counsel\n",
       "therefore is, seeing that armed men are everywhere, let us make\n",
       "ourselves as armed men. Let our hands, weak though they be by nature,\n",
       "learn to handle the spear and the sword, nor shall we fail therein, for\n",
       "there are no scholars so apt as they who have need for their teacher.\n",
       "And, indeed, my daughter, you are one who should easily learn such\n",
       "matters, for you are both tall and strong, and need practice only, which\n",
       "being had, you should be as truly martial a maid as you could wish. Nor\n",
       "is such a thing unknown in the race from which you come. Such was the\n",
       "bold Boadicea, who reigned in old time over the Iceni, for she made\n",
       "haughty Rome to tremble before her, and others, as Gwendolen and\n",
       "Emmilen. Hear also this thing which I saw with my own eyes. On the\n",
       "battlefield at Menevia, where King Uther last fought against the pagan\n",
       "hosts, there was a Saxon virgin who thrice struck to the earth the great\n",
       "Ulfin himself. Verily she had slain him as he lay, but that Caradoc held\n",
       "her hand, and Caradoc himself had much ado to escape from her without\n",
       "hurt.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Tell me, I pray you, her name,” said Britomart.\n",
       "\n",
       "“They call her Angela,” the nurse made answer, “and she is as fair as\n",
       "she is strong. She is the leader of a tribe who are more to be feared\n",
       "than all other Saxons; they call themselves Angles.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Much was the maiden moved by this tale, so that she made her resolve,\n",
       "unknown to her father, to take upon herself all the duties and\n",
       "adventures which were fitting to a knight. And she said to her nurse:\n",
       "“See, Glaucé, that you have all things ready that are convenient to my\n",
       "new estate.” And this Glaucé did with all readiness and care. Fortune\n",
       "also helped in the matter; for about this time a band of Britons, being\n",
       "abroad on a foray, took a great spoil of Saxon goods, and among them\n",
       "goodly armour decked with gold, and arms of proof which belonged to the\n",
       "Saxon queen Angela. These spoils King Ryence commanded to be hung up in\n",
       "the chapel of his palace, that they might be a memorial for all time of\n",
       "the great victory which God had given to his arms. Into this same chapel\n",
       "Glaucé led the maiden Britomart late in the night when no one was near,\n",
       "and taking down the armour, clad her in it, and she gave her the arms\n",
       "also, chief among these being a wonderful spear which King Bladud had\n",
       "made by magical arts many years before. This virtue it had, that\n",
       "whosoever might be struck by the point thereof, could not stay in his\n",
       "saddle, but must be borne to the ground. And when Glaucé had so\n",
       "furnished the maiden with due equipment of war, then she took for\n",
       "herself such arms and armour as befitted a squire, and put them on. This\n",
       "done, they left the place by secret ways, unseen of any. Thus did it\n",
       "happen that Britomart came in guise of a knight into the company of Sir\n",
       "Guyon and the Red-Cross Knight.\n",
       "\n",
       "Not long after this they parted from each other, for the Knight had an\n",
       "errand of his own, and Britomart was bent on the finding of Sir\n",
       "Artegall. Many miles did she ride, and through many lands did she\n",
       "travel, till at last she came to the shore of the sea. There she lighted\n",
       "from off her horse and bade Glaucé unlace her helmet, and sat down upon\n",
       "a rock to rest awhile and refresh herself with the breeze that blew from\n",
       "off the waves. And as she sat, she thought within herself: “Ah me, how\n",
       "like is love to this restless sea! How shall my frail bark escape where\n",
       "there are so many dangers, and no certain guide?” So she spake to\n",
       "herself, sighing the while; weep she would not, for tears, she thought,\n",
       "did not become a knight. But Glaucé comforted her, calling to her mind\n",
       "what Merlin had prophesied about the things to come. Nor were these\n",
       "words in vain; but there soon befell a thing which roused her more than\n",
       "many words. She spied a knight in shining armour riding towards her in\n",
       "all haste, with his spear in rest as one that had some hostile purpose.\n",
       "Quickly she mounted her horse, and bade Glaucé lace her helmet, and\n",
       "addressed herself without delay to battle. Now, by the time she had put\n",
       "her shield in place and made ready her spear, the knight was close at\n",
       "hand.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Sir Knight,” said he, “know you that you travel on this road against my\n",
       "strict commands? I suffer not any to pass by this way. Others who have\n",
       "so trespassed have come by their death. Therefore I counsel you to go\n",
       "back while there is yet time.”\n",
       "\n",
       "She made answer in few words: “Let them fly who have need for flight.\n",
       "You may frighten children with your words. As for passing by this way, I\n",
       "am prepared to do it, even without your leave. Verily, I will pass or\n",
       "die.” Scarcely had she spoken when the stranger knight rode at her with\n",
       "his spear in rest. He smote her full on the breast, and she bowed her\n",
       "head, so fierce was the stroke, till it well-nigh touched the crupper of\n",
       "her saddle. But her counter-stroke was deadlier by far. The spear-point\n",
       "passed through his shield and through his cuirass, and, glancing thence,\n",
       "pierced his left side. The power of the stroke bore him from the saddle,\n",
       "and laid him bleeding on the ground, where he lay wallowing in his\n",
       "blood. So fell the knight, Sir Marinell, upon the shore which he called\n",
       "his own. And Britomart rode on; and as she went she saw pearls and\n",
       "precious stones of every kind, and ingots of gold half buried in the\n",
       "sand. Much she wondered to see such riches, but she would not descend\n",
       "for a single hour. What were jewels or precious stones or gold to her,\n",
       "that they should hinder her in her quest?\n",
       "\n",
       "The story of Sir Marinell, briefly told, is this. His mother was a\n",
       "daughter of Nereus, God of the Sea, and his father a mortal man. He was\n",
       "reared up in arms, and became a great and famous knight. And he had for\n",
       "his possession this same shore; a place in which Nature of her own will\n",
       "had set much riches, pearls and precious stones and the like, and to\n",
       "which, by the ordering of Nereus, great store of the treasure which the\n",
       "sea swallows up through shipwreck was brought, for his daughter made\n",
       "request of the same for her son. This coast, then, he most jealously\n",
       "guarded against all comers. And being, as has been said, valiant and\n",
       "strong and expert in arms, and also because he knew the place and was\n",
       "able to take a new-comer unawares, he seemed to be invincible. Many\n",
       "knights, seeking to pass along the coast, for, indeed, the fame of its\n",
       "treasures was spread abroad, were slain, and yet more, being vanquished\n",
       "in battle, for life’s sake, submitted themselves to him, and became\n",
       "vassals and servants to him. One hundred knights, men of name all of\n",
       "them, were so bound to his service. In the end, Sir Marinell, what with\n",
       "the multitude of his riches, and the pride of having so many knights of\n",
       "renown at his beck and call, became not a little puffed up, and his\n",
       "mother, knowing that the wise man had said of old, “Pride goeth before a\n",
       "fall,” would fain know how he might be kept from mischief. So she went\n",
       "to a certain god of the sea, Proteus by name, who had the gift of\n",
       "foretelling things to come. And Proteus said to her: “My daughter, keep\n",
       "this thy son from all womankind, for from a woman he shall have a deadly\n",
       "hurt.” And the mother, taking these words to be spoken of woman’s love,\n",
       "set her son’s mind against all such things, and did most carefully keep\n",
       "him from all company of women. And he, to do her pleasure, obeyed her in\n",
       "this matter, yet could not so escape his fate. And this fate was all the\n",
       "harder, because this knight was beloved of a fair and virtuous maiden,\n",
       "Florimell by name, whom he might have wedded much to his joy and profit.\n",
       "Of this same Florimell more shall be told hereafter.\n",
       "\n",
       "Britomart, after having thus vanquished Sir Marinell, still went on her\n",
       "quest, and came at night to the castle of a certain Malbecco. To this\n",
       "same place there had also come, earlier by the space of an hour or so,\n",
       "two other knights, Sir Paridell and Sir Satyrane. It was this same\n",
       "Satyrane that helped the Lady Una in her wanderings when she was parted\n",
       "by evil chance from the Red-Cross Knight. To them Sir Paridell’s squire\n",
       "had said: “My lords, you will not find entertainment here. The master of\n",
       "this castle, Malbecco by name, is a mere churl, and hates all company,\n",
       "and this for two reasons: the first of these reasons is that his mind is\n",
       "wholly set on riches, and he hates all doings by which they may seem to\n",
       "be wasted; and the second is that he, being old and crabbed, is wedded\n",
       "to a very fair young wife, whom he would fain keep from the sight of all\n",
       "eyes but his own. Verily he keeps her as in prison.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When Sir Paridell heard the squire’s story, he said: “Why do we suffer\n",
       "this old dotard to behave himself in this churlish fashion? ’Twere\n",
       "better to kill the villain and spoil his home.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay,” said Sir Satyrane, who was a loyal and true knight, and would\n",
       "fain bear himself honestly to all men; “we will first gently entreat\n",
       "this man to give us entertainment. And if he will not listen to gentle\n",
       "words, then will we threaten him; for some who heed not fair words will\n",
       "take account of foul. And if we accomplish nothing either by entreaties\n",
       "or by threats, then we will make our way into his dwelling by force, and\n",
       "deal with him as he deserves.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“So be it,” said Sir Paridell, and coming to the gate he knocked. “Sir\n",
       "Porter,” he said, “two knights seek shelter and entertainment.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Now the porter was Malbecco himself, for it was his custom to play the\n",
       "porter’s part. He answered: “All in this house, my friend, are now gone\n",
       "to their beds, and the keys have been taken to the master of the house,\n",
       "and he also is in his bed, nor is there anyone so bold that would\n",
       "venture to wake him from his sleep. I pray you, therefore, to be patient\n",
       "and to seek entertainment elsewhere.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The two knights were not a little wroth at this fellow’s churlishness,\n",
       "but knew not what they should do, for he took no heed, neither of\n",
       "blandishments nor of threats. And while they parleyed with him, the sky\n",
       "was overcast, and there came so bitter a blast of wind and so fierce a\n",
       "storm of rain and hail that they were constrained to depart and seek\n",
       "shelter in a little hut that was near at hand, being a sty for pigs.\n",
       "While they were faring as best they could in this place, there came\n",
       "another knight to the castle gate. He also sought for entertainment and\n",
       "was denied, and he also, under compulsion from the storm, sought shelter\n",
       "in the hut. And when, the place being indeed already filled, he was not\n",
       "suffered to enter, he fell into a great rage.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay,” said he, “this will I not suffer. Either I will lodge with you,\n",
       "or you shall be dislodged. Choose then whether of these two things ye\n",
       "will have.” The two knights scarce knew how they should answer him. They\n",
       "liked not to deny him lodging, and they liked not to yield to his\n",
       "boasting. But of the two Paridell was the less disposed to take the\n",
       "matter patiently.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Who is this fellow,” said he, “who talks to me as though he were rating\n",
       "a dog in a kennel? Of a truth, if he is a dog of spirit, he would rather\n",
       "die than lie like a coward in a corner.” So saying, he issued forth, and\n",
       "came to blows with the stranger. And doubtless mischief had been done\n",
       "but that the good Satyrane made peace between them. This done, they\n",
       "agreed together to punish the lord of the castle for his churlishness.\n",
       "So they went back to the gate, and Paridell cried aloud: “Hark, Sir\n",
       "Porter, whoever you are, if you open not this gate, then we will burn\n",
       "this place and all that is therein with fire.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When Malbecco heard this, perceiving that they were in earnest, he ran\n",
       "with all speed and called to them from the castle walls. “Bear with me,\n",
       "fair sirs,” he cried, “and pardon me, seeing that I am so ill-served.\n",
       "These loutish knaves of mine know not their duty, and fail to attend as\n",
       "they should upon strangers.” When they heard this, the knights consented\n",
       "to let the matter be, though they believed not a word of what the man\n",
       "had said. So they entered the castle. Being within the walls, they rid\n",
       "themselves of their armour, for they were fain to dry their garments at\n",
       "the fire. And lo! when the last come of the three took off his helmet,\n",
       "the hair, which was of golden hue, broke loose from its tie and fell\n",
       "down to her feet, like the sunbeams that fall from a cloud; and when she\n",
       "doffed her coat of mail and let down the pleated frock she had tucked up\n",
       "for convenience’ sake in riding, then it was plain to see that she was a\n",
       "woman, and indeed the very fairest of women; for in sooth this last come\n",
       "of the three knights was Britomart.\n",

       "Britomart, riding forth on the day following from Malbecco’s Castle,\n",
       "came to a fountain whereby a knight was lying stretched upon the ground.\n",
       "His cuirass and his helmet and his spear lay near him, and his shield,\n",
       "on which was the emblem of love, as a boy with wings, was thrown\n",
       "carelessly on the ground. He lay with his face upon the ground, and it\n",
       "seemed as if he were asleep, so that Britomart of her courtesy held\n",
       "back, lest perchance she should wake him. But as she stood, she heard\n",
       "him groan, and after break forth into bitter complaining: “O God,” he\n",
       "cried, “who rulest in bliss among Thy saints, why sufferest Thou such\n",
       "cruel deeds to be done? Hast Thou no care for the cause of the innocent?\n",
       "Is Thy justice asleep? What doth it profit a man to do righteously if\n",
       "righteousness find no reward? Never was there on earth a creature more\n",
       "gracious than my Amoret; and lo! for seven months the tyrant Busirane\n",
       "holds her in prison, and all, forsooth, because she will not deny her\n",
       "Scudamore. And I, this same Scudamore, am safe and sound, and yet can\n",
       "help her not at all!” Then he burst forth into a storm of sobs. So\n",
       "shaken and disturbed was he with the torment of his grief, that\n",
       "Britomart feared that he might even die. So, stooping down, she touched\n",
       "him lightly on the shoulder. Whereat he, starting up, looked to see what\n",
       "had happened; and finding that it was but a stranger knight, he threw\n",
       "himself again upon the ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said Britomart: “Sir Knight, whose sorrow seems to overpass your\n",
       "patience, I would counsel you to submit your will to the providence of\n",
       "God. Remember, if you will, that virtue and faith are mightier than the\n",
       "very worst of sorrows. Surely he who cannot bear the burden of this\n",
       "world’s distresses must not think to live, for life is a distressful\n",
       "thing. And now, tell me what this villain of whom you speak has done.\n",
       "Maybe this hand of mine may help you to win relief and redress.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said the knight: “Ah me! it is idle to complain of what may not be\n",
       "cured. I fear me much that there is no remedy for this trouble. How can\n",
       "we deliver my Amoret from the dungeon in which this tyrant holds her,\n",
       "and all because she will not accept his love, nor be false to me? For,\n",
       "indeed, he has fortified the place with such magic charms that no power\n",
       "of man can overcome them.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nevertheless,” said Britomart, “we will make our endeavour.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Why should you die for me?” said the knight. “It is enough that I\n",
       "should perish, who deserve it well.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay,” cried Britomart, “life is not lost if the fame that dies not be\n",
       "bought with it.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So at last she persuaded him to rise from the ground. His armour she\n",
       "helped him to put on, and his horse, which had strayed away, she brought\n",
       "back to him. Then they set off for the magician’s castle, which was but\n",
       "a bow-shot away. But when they were arrived, lo! there was no gate, no,\n",
       "nor porter, nor watchman, but in the porch there was a flaming fire and\n",
       "a great smoke of sulphur; so fierce was the fire and so thick the smoke\n",
       "that they were compelled to fall back.\n",
       "\n",
       "“To run into danger without thought, Sir Knight,” said Britomart, “is\n",
       "becoming to a beast, not to a man. Let us think, therefore, how we may\n",
       "most prudently deal with this enemy.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Alas!” answered Sir Scudamore, for this was the knight’s name, “here\n",
       "you see the doleful straits in which I stand. This is the trouble of\n",
       "which I complained. By no cleverness or strength or valor may these\n",
       "flames be quenched, for no man can undo the enchantments by which they\n",
       "have been kindled. Leave me to my complaints. Fair Amoret must dwell as\n",
       "before in this evil prison, and Scudamore must die of sorrow.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“By heaven!” cried Britomart, “it were a shameful thing to give up some\n",
       "noble purpose for fear of danger, without some venture made. Let us make\n",
       "a trial at the least, and see what shall come to pass.”\n",
       "\n",
       "And as she spoke the bold maiden threw her broad shield before her face,\n",
       "and pointing her sword straight in front of her, threw herself upon the\n",
       "fire; and behold the flames straightway parted asunder, leaving a space\n",
       "in the middle through which she passed, as a flash of lightning passes\n",
       "through the clouds. And when Sir Scudamore saw how she had traversed the\n",
       "fire safe and untouched, he essayed to follow her. But whether it was\n",
       "that there was a certain jealousy in his heart, or some less pure\n",
       "desire, or some lack of faith, to him the flames yielded not one jot.\n",
       "His pride and fierceness availed him nothing; he was constrained to\n",
       "return most piteously burnt. Greatly was he troubled at this defeat, so\n",
       "that he threw himself on the ground and groaned aloud in the bitterness\n",
       "of his heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "Britomart meanwhile had made her way into the palace of the Enchanter.\n",
       "The first chamber was a wondrous place, all its walls being covered with\n",
       "tapestries picturing the triumphs of love. Many a strange tale of the\n",
       "gods might there be seen, and with the gods was shown a great multitude\n",
       "of men and women, both of high degree and low, kings and queens and\n",
       "knights and ladies, and peasants and women who worked with their hands,\n",
       "for love has no respect of person, and there are none but feel his\n",
       "power. And round about the tapestries was woven a border of broken bows\n",
       "and shivered arrows, and through them flowed as it were a river of\n",
       "blood. At the end of the chamber was an altar, and on the altar was set\n",
       "the image of a boy. Blindfolded was he, and in his hand he held a deadly\n",
       "bow with an arrow set. And on his shoulders he carried a quiver, and\n",
       "some of the shots were tipped with gold and some with lead, and under\n",
       "his foot was a dragon which had been smitten through with a dart. Under\n",
       "his feet was written this inscription: “The Conqueror of the Gods.” All\n",
       "this the maid beheld, and also she saw that over every door in the\n",
       "chamber, and there were many such doors, the words were written: “Be\n",
       "Bold!” But over one door at the very end of the chamber were these words\n",
       "to be seen, “Be not Over-Bold.” Much she marvelled to see no living\n",
       "creature, for the whole place was silent and empty. But the day being\n",
       "now far spent, she lay down to sleep, but was careful to keep her arms\n",
       "close at hand should need arise.\n",
       "\n",
       "She slept not untroubled. First there was the sound of a great trumpet;\n",
       "but whether it were blown for victory or for warning she knew not. And\n",
       "after the trumpet there was a great storm of wind, with thunder and\n",
       "lightning, and after the lightning an earthquake, and after the\n",
       "earthquake a great stench and smoke of sulphur, yet was not Britomart\n",
       "one whit dismayed. Then, as she wondered what these things might mean, a\n",
       "great whirlwind blew throughout the house, and the door over which the\n",
       "words “Be not Over-Bold” were written, flew open of its own accord. And\n",
       "out of it there issued a marvellous array.\n",
       "\n",
       "First came Fancy, in likeness of a lovely boy, and after him Desire, and\n",
       "then Doubt, ever looking about him with restless eyes, and Danger, and\n",
       "Fear, who ever kept his eye on Danger, and Hope in the semblance of a\n",
       "happy maiden, and Suspicion, and Grief and Fury, and many more, which it\n",
       "were long to name one by one. Thrice did they march round the chamber,\n",
       "and then returned to that within from which they had come forth. And\n",
       "when the last had passed through, the door shut as it had opened at the\n",
       "first, of its own accord. And when the maid would have passed through\n",
       "it, she found it locked fast against her and beyond all her strength to\n",
       "open. Then, finding that she could do nothing by force, she had recourse\n",
       "to craft, purposing not to depart from the chamber till the next night\n",
       "should come, and with the night the same procession of figures should\n",
       "come forth. And so it fell out, and when the door opened next of its own\n",
       "accord, then Britomart went boldly in. Not one single figure did she see\n",
       "of all that wondrous company. There was no living creature in the\n",
       "chamber, save one lady of woeful aspect, whose hands were bound fast\n",
       "together, while round her waist was a chain which bound her to a pillar.\n",
       "And before her sat the Enchanter, making strange characters, which were\n",
       "among the devices of his art. In blood he drew them, and the blood\n",
       "seemed to be drawn from the woeful lady’s heart by an arrow which was\n",
       "fastened in her side. When the Enchanter saw the maid he cast his magic\n",
       "book in haste to the ground, and drawing from his vest a murderous\n",
       "knife, made as though he would have thrust it into the lady’s side. But\n",
       "the maid caught his hand and mastered him. Not so completely did she\n",
       "quell him but that with a sudden wrench he turned the dagger upon her\n",
       "and struck it into her chest. It was but a shallow wound, but it moved\n",
       "her wrath, and she, drawing forth her sword, dealt him a mighty blow, so\n",
       "that he fell half dead upon the ground. But as she made ready to smite\n",
       "him again, the woeful lady cried: “Slay him not, for if he die then am I\n",
       "here fast bound for ever; for only he that has bound can loosen.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Full wroth was Britomart to spare so foul a wretch. Nevertheless, for\n",
       "the lady’s sake, she held her hand, and said: “O wicked man, death, or\n",
       "that which is worse than death, if such there be, is the due reward of\n",
       "your crimes. Nevertheless you may live if you will restore this lady to\n",
       "her first estate.” To this the wretch, so reprieved beyond all hope,\n",
       "gave a willing consent, and taking up his book began to reverse his evil\n",
       "charms. Many a dreadful thing did he read which the lady heard with\n",
       "trembling, seeing that they had brought her to this evil plight. And all\n",
       "the while Britomart stood, with her sword drawn over his head, ready to\n",
       "smite him if he should fail of his promise. And now all the house began\n",
       "to shake around them, and the doors to rattle. Yet was not the maid\n",
       "dismayed, but watched the villain as he undid the charm. And now the\n",
       "chain was broken from off the lady’s hands, and that which did bind her\n",
       "to the pillar was severed, and the pillar itself fell into ruins, and\n",
       "the steel by which her life-blood was drained away came forth from the\n",
       "wound, no one drawing it, and the wound itself was closed and the lady\n",
       "herself restored to her first estate.\n",
       "\n",
       "When she found herself thus whole again, she poured out her heart in\n",
       "thanks to the maid, throwing herself upon the ground before her. “Gentle\n",
       "lady,” said Britomart, “it is reward enough to have done you this\n",
       "service. And now forget your trouble, and take comfort to yourself and\n",
       "comfort also the true knight who has suffered so much for your sake.”\n",
       "Right glad was Amoret to hear such kindly words of the man whom she\n",
       "loved. Then did Britomart take the chain with which Amoret had been\n",
       "bound and bind the Enchanter with it. And this was a fit beginning of\n",
       "the punishment which was to fall upon him. This done, they turned to\n",
       "depart, and as they passed through the Enchanter’s abode, lo! all the\n",
       "grace and glory had departed from it; all the fair picturings were\n",
       "defaced, and when they came to the fiery porch, the flames were\n",
       "vanished, and the place was like to a torch that is half burned.\n",
       "\n",
       "But as nothing in the world is without trouble, so to their great\n",

       "Lady Amoret. Nevertheless this same lady was somewhat in doubt how she\n",
       "should bear herself to her deliverer. For, on the one hand, she was well\n",
       "aware that all her love and homage was due to Sir Scudamore, nor was\n",
       "there aught in her heart that hindered her from rendering it. It should\n",
       "be told indeed that she was not only betrothed to this same Scudamore,\n",
       "but verily wedded, only it had come to pass on the very wedding-day,\n",
       "when the guests were somewhat overtaken with wine, that the enchanter\n",

       "her away into captivity. So now she said to herself:\n",
       "\n",
       "“This is a very noble knight, and it irks me to show him any\n",
       "discourtesy; yet, on the other hand, I fear me much lest I should seem\n",
       "in any wise disloyal to my own dear lord,” for she knew not that\n",
       "Britomart was a maid. And Britomart, on her part, desiring that the\n",
       "secret should not be known, bore herself with a certain freedom. Nothing\n",
       "unseemly did she say or do; but none had guessed her to be what she was.\n",
       "\n",
       "As they journeyed together they came to a castle, where a great company\n",
       "of knights and ladies had assembled to hold a tournament. Now it was a\n",
       "custom of tournament that every knight entering the lists bore the\n",
       "colours of some lady, and averred that she was the fairest of all\n",
       "ladies, and that he would prove it with spear and sword. Thus it came to\n",
       "pass that when the knights were gathered together, and the master of the\n",
       "ceremony asked of each his lady’s name, a certain young and lusty knight\n",
       "cried out, “My lady is the fair Amoret, and that I will avow with spear\n",
       "and sword.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When Britomart heard these words she was not a little wroth;\n",
       "nevertheless she dissembled her anger, and said only, “I am loath to\n",
       "make strife; but this young man must needs make good his words!” So they\n",
       "jousted together, and the knight was easily overthrown, being thus made\n",
       "to suffer for coveting that which was not his. But Britomart, seeing\n",
       "that he was a brave man, and being herself as courteous as she was\n",
       "strong, cast about how she could save his honour. She said, therefore,\n",
       "to the master of the ceremony: “Let me have this knight for my\n",
       "champion.” And as she spoke she doffed her helmet, and her golden hair,\n",
       "which had been cunningly coiled up within, fell down to her very feet.\n",
       "All that stood by, both ladies and knights, were not a little amazed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some said, “This is wrought by magic!” others, “This is Bellona’s self\n",
       "that has come among mortal men.” As for the young knight, he worshipped\n",
       "her as though she were divine, and the fair Amoret, all her doubts being\n",
       "removed, was knit to her in the closest bonds of affection and\n",
       "tenderness.\n",
       "\n",
       "The next morning they departed together from the castle, the one ever\n",
       "cherishing in her heart the thought of Sir Artegall and the other of Sir\n",
       "Scudamore. After a while they were aware of two knights riding towards\n",
       "them, having each a lady at his side; ladies, indeed, they were not,\n",
       "save in outward appearance, for one was the false Duessa, the other was\n",
       "called Até, which name by interpretation is Strife, than whom there is\n",
       "no more baleful creature under the sun, and she has her dwelling hard by\n",
       "the gates of hell. Many ways are there by which a man may go into that\n",
       "place, but none by which he may come forth. And the walls on every side\n",
       "are hung with the rent robes and broken sceptres of kings, shivered\n",
       "spears and shields torn in twain, spoils of Babylon and of Rome, relics\n",
       "of great empires that have been and are no more. Até herself was hideous\n",
       "to behold, if one could see her as she was in truth. But now she was\n",
       "fair to look at, for she had put on, as can all evil things, the\n",
       "semblance of beauty.\n",
       "\n",
       "The knight who rode by her side was a certain Blandamour, gallant and\n",
       "strong, and most expert in arms, but of a fickle and inconstant heart;\n",
       "and he that was companion to the false Duessa was Sir Paridell. When Sir\n",
       "Blandamour saw from afar Britomart and Amoret, he said to Sir Paridell:\n",
       "“See you, my friend, that knight with a lady by his side? There is a\n",
       "fair adventure for you!” But Sir Paridell, for now they were near enough\n",
       "to discern the fashion of Britomart’s arms, perceived that this knight\n",
       "bore the like scutcheon to one by whom he had of late been worsted in\n",
       "battle; nor was he minded to tempt his fate again.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I know that knight full well, Sir Blandamour,” he said; “he proved his\n",
       "skill on me, and I count it folly when he who has escaped a danger\n",
       "challenges it again.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Then I,” replied Sir Blandamour, “will try my fortune; take you,\n",
       "meanwhile, this dame in charge.” And he laid his spear in rest and\n",
       "charged. Britomart, on her part, made ready to receive him, and gave him\n",
       "an uncouth welcome. Scarce had they met than he found himself lying\n",
       "helpless on the ground. Meanwhile his conquering adversary rode on, not\n",
       "deigning so much as to say a single word.\n",
       "\n",
       "When his companions saw in what an evil plight he was, they hastened to\n",
       "his help, and put him on his steed, for mount himself he could not, and\n",
       "held him up as he rode. Ill-content he was that he had ventured so much\n",
       "and won so little.\n",
       "\n",
       "After that they had journeyed awhile, they saw two knights coming\n",
       "towards them across the plain. When Sir Blandamour perceived them, he\n",
       "grieved more than ever for his late mishap, for he saw that one of them\n",
       "was his old enemy Sir Scudamore, knowing him to be such by the device\n",
       "that he wore, to wit, the god of love with his wings spread out on this\n",
       "side and on that. “Here,” he said to himself, “is evil fortune! Yonder\n",
       "is my enemy, and I am so bruised with this late encounter that I cannot\n",
       "do battle with him.” Then he said to Sir Paridell: “My friend, will you,\n",
       "of your affection, do somewhat for me, even as I have done for you? My\n",
       "hurts keep me back from battle, but I have just cause of enmity against\n",
       "yonder knight. Will you, therefore, maintain this my cause against him?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Paridell answered: “Trouble not yourself. There is a proverb that\n",
       "the left hand rubs the right. As you have fought for me, so will I for\n",
       "you.” Forthwith he laid his spear in rest, and charged, swift as an\n",
       "arrow from a bow. Nor was Sir Scudamore slow to make himself ready. So\n",
       "they met in fierce encounter, and with so great a shock, that both were\n",
       "driven from their saddles, and they lay stretched upon the ground. Sir\n",
       "Scudamore was soon on his feet again, and said to the other: “Laggard,\n",
       "why lie you so long?” But Sir Paridell lay tumbled in a heap, without\n",
       "sense or speech, all unheeding of his adversary’s reproach. Then his\n",
       "companion ran to him, and unlaced his helmet, and loosened his coat of\n",
       "mail, and so brought him back to feeling; but not a word did he speak.\n",
       "Then said Sir Blandamour:\n",
       "\n",
       "“False knight, you have overcome by craft a better man than yourself. It\n",
       "is well for you that I am not in such good case to-day that I can avenge\n",
       "him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "To this Sir Scudamore made no answer, though there was great anger in\n",
       "his heart. Then the false Duessa, not seeing how her ends would be\n",
       "served by a quarrel between these two, would have made peace between\n",
       "them. But, on the other hand, Até made up a fresh contention, for she\n",
       "turned Sir Scudamore against Amoret, slandering that true lady with\n",
       "false tales of how she had given her love to a stranger knight, who,\n",
       "indeed, was none other than Britomart. Nor was she content with this,\n",
       "but she made a quarrel also between Paridell and Blandamour. And the\n",
       "contention between these two grew so hot that they were ready to do\n",
       "battle with each other. What had been the end thereof none can say, but\n",
       "by good luck there came that way a certain squire who was well known to\n",
       "both, and not a little beloved by them. No easy thing was it for him to\n",
       "get hearing from the two, so full of fury were they. Yet, at the last,\n",
       "he persuaded them to stay their hands. This done, he said: “Brave\n",
       "knights, you ought to be at peace and not at variance. There are those\n",
       "that seek your harm, and you would do well to ally yourselves against\n",
       "them.” Thus he persuaded them to swear friendship again. So being\n",
       "reconciled, they pursued their journey. After a while they saw two\n",
       "knights and two ladies with them, and they sent on their squire to\n",
       "inquire who these might be. And when the squire came back to his company\n",
       "he said: “These are two famous knights, brave Cambell and stout\n",
       "Triamond; and the ladies are Cambina, who is wife to Cambell, and\n",
       "Canacé, who is wedded to Triamond. But would it please you, gentle sirs,\n",
       "to hear their story, for I know it well, and it is worth the hearing?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Blandamour answered, “Speak on.” So the squire told this tale that\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "There was a great lady in Fairyland, Agapé by name, who had three sons,\n",
       "born all of them at one birth; and the names of the three were Priamond,\n",
       "Diamond, and Triamond. Also she had a daughter, Cambina by name. Now the\n",
       "Lady Agapé greatly desired to know how long her sons should live, for\n",
       "they, having a mortal for their father, must needs die some day, whereas\n",
       "she, being of fairy race, was immortal. Having, therefore, this thought\n",
       "in her mind, she made her way to the place where the three Fates sit by\n",
       "the distaff spinning the lines of Life. One sister draws out the thread,\n",
       "and another turns the spindle, and yet another, sitting by with the\n",
       "shears in her hand, cuts the thread when the due time is come. Deep in\n",
       "the hidden places of the earth was the dwelling of the three, and the\n",
       "way thereto was dark and hard to find; but Agapé had in her heart all\n",
       "the wisdom of Fairyland, nor did she fail to accomplish her purpose.\n",
       "When she had come to the place she sat awhile, and watched the sisters\n",
       "at their work. At last, having seen all that they did, she declared why\n",
       "she had come: “I have three sons,” she said, “mortal men, though I\n",
       "myself am immortal; and I greatly desire to know how long they will\n",
       "live.” One of the sisters, she that held the shears, was very angry when\n",
       "she heard these words: “You have done ill,” she said, “in coming here on\n",
       "this errand. These things are not for anyone, mortal or immortal, to\n",
       "know. You deserve to be smitten with the Curse of Jupiter—you and your\n",
       "children with you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "[Illustration: Agapé approaching the Dwelling of the Fates.]\n",
       "\n",
       "Agapé was greatly frightened at these words. Still she held to her\n",
       "purpose, and with many prayers and entreaties prevailed upon her that\n",
       "held the spindle, for she was less hard of heart than the sister who\n",
       "held the shears, to show her the threads of the three youths. When she\n",
       "saw them she cried, “I pray you draw them out longer and of a stouter\n",
       "thread.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay,” said the sister, “think you, O foolish one, that the purposes of\n",
       "the Fates may be changed as are the purposes of men? It is not so; what\n",
       "they decree stands fast for ever; the gods may not move it by one\n",
       "hair’s-breadth, no, nor the ruler of the gods himself.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then answered Agapé: “If this be so, if you cannot add one jot to the\n",
       "thread of any man’s life, still there is a boon which you can give me. I\n",
       "see the thread of my eldest son, and it is, I perceive, the shortest of\n",
       "the three. Grant that when it is cut with the shears, it may be added to\n",
       "the thread of the second, and that in like manner when the thread of the\n",
       "second is cut, it may be joined to the third. So shall he have a treble\n",
       "portion, and yet the whole shall not have been increased.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The sisters said, “This shall be so.” Thereupon the Lady Agapé departed\n",
       "to her own home. She told her sons nothing of this journey which she had\n",
       "taken, or of the things which she had seen and heard, or of the boon\n",
       "which had been granted to her in the matter of their lives. But she said\n",
       "to them, not at that time only, but after, whenever she could find\n",
       "occasion: “O my sons, be careful and walk in safe ways; but, above all\n",
       "things, love one another, whatever may befall.” And this they did all\n",
       "their lives. Never was there any strife between them, but only great\n",
       "friendship and concord, of which the most signal proof is now to be\n",
       "told.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was a fair lady in those parts, Canacé by name, who was wiser than\n",
       "all the women of her day. She knew all the powers of nature, and could\n",
       "see beforehand the things that should come to pass, and knew the speech\n",
       "of beasts and birds. And as she was wise above all others, so also did\n",
       "she excel in goodness. To these things she added also a singular beauty,\n",
       "so that many lords and knights of the land came to woo her. To these she\n",
       "bare herself rightly courteously, but favoured none, no, not so much as\n",
       "by a word or a look. But it came to pass, as is the way in such matters,\n",
       "that the more she held herself aloof, the more eagerly did these lords\n",
       "and knights urge their suit upon her. And not a few quarrels came about\n",
       "on her account, one suitor meeting another in battle. Now this Canacé\n",
       "had a brother, Cambell by name, as brave and stout a knight as ever\n",
       "lived. And he, seeing that great mischief might arise out of these\n",
       "quarrels concerning his sister, caused all her wooers to come together,\n",
       "and made this proclamation among them:\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ye Lords and Knights that seek my sister Canacé in marriage, choose now\n",
       "from among yourselves the three whom you judge to be the boldest and\n",
       "most skilful in battle among you, and let them meet me in combat, man by\n",
       "man, and it shall be that whosoever of the three shall prevail over me\n",
       "shall have my sister to wife.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Now this Cambell was, as has been already said, a brave knight and a\n",
       "stout; yet for all his strength and courage he had scarcely dared to\n",
       "stand up in this fashion against so many. For, indeed, it might well\n",
       "come to pass, such are the chances of battle, that one or other might\n",
       "prevail over him, not being the better man, but by reason of some\n",
       "accident. But there was that which encouraged him to dare so much, to\n",
       "wit, a magic ring which his sister had given him. It was a ring of many\n",
       "virtues, but the chief of them all was this, that if he who wore it\n",
       "should be wounded, this ring straightway staunched the bleeding.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now this matter of the magic ring and its marvellous virtues was known\n",
       "to all, and the suitors of the Lady Canacé were, for the most part,\n",
       "terrified by it, so that they would not venture on the battle. “Fair she\n",
       "is without doubt,” they said, “but it would be a fool’s part to venture\n",
       "life even for her.” Nevertheless there were three among them who were\n",
       "not of this way of thinking, and these three were the brothers Priamond,\n",
       "Diamond, and Triamond. They all loved the Princess, and yet, so\n",
       "brotherly were they in heart and mind, that there was not a thought of\n",
       "anger or jealousy among them. “Let her choose,” said they, “between us,\n",
       "and we will be content with her choice. Or, if the judgment be left to\n",
       "the sword, then let him be preferred who shall overcome this her brother\n",
       "Cambell.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So the three addressed themselves to the battle in the order of their\n",
       "age. First came Priamond, the eldest, a stout knight to hold his place,\n",
       "but he was not so strong to strike as are some. He loved to fight on\n",
       "foot, and his arms were the spear and the battle-axe. Next to him was\n",
       "Diamond; he was one to deal mighty blows, but he was not so good in\n",
       "holding his ground. Whether he were on horseback or on foot he cared\n",
       "not, so that he had his battle-axe in hand, for with this he loved to\n",
       "fight. Last of all came Triamond. There was no man better than he,\n",
       "whether to stand or to strike; the fight on horseback pleased him best,\n",
       "and his arms were spear and shield.\n",
       "\n",
       "On a set day the lists were prepared. Barriers were made to keep off the\n",
       "press of the people. At one end sat six judges, who should see that all\n",
       "things were done decently and in order, and that neither this warrior\n",
       "nor that should take undue advantage; and at the other was set the fair\n",
       "Canacé on a stage, that she might see the battle and herself be seen.\n",
       "The first that came into the lists was Sir Cambell. Noble was his mien\n",
       "and assured his look, as of one that knew certainly that he should\n",
       "prevail. After him advanced the three brothers, bravely attired and\n",
       "shining in arms, each with his banner borne before him. Thrice did they\n",
       "bow themselves before the fair Canacé, and then a blast of the trumpet\n",
       "gave the signal for battle.\n",
       "\n",
       "First of the three to meet Sir Cambell came Priamond; well skilled in\n",
       "arms were the two, and for long they fought without advantage to one or\n",
       "the other. Mighty the blows that they dealt, but both had watchful eyes\n",
       "and ready skill to turn the deadliest stroke aside. The first gain fell\n",
       "to Sir Priamond, for his spear, whether by good fortune or by skill it\n",
       "were hard to say, passed by his adversary’s shield and pierced the\n",
       "shoulder where a joint of the armour gave it access. Deep was the wound,\n",
       "and though no blood flowed therefrom—such was the virtue of the magic\n",
       "ring—it stung the warrior to the quick with keenest pain. There are\n",
       "whose spirit is quelled with pain; but Sir Cambell was not of these. The\n",
       "smart did but rouse his courage to the utmost, and put new strength into\n",
       "his arm. Straightway he drave his spear close underneath Sir Priamond’s\n",
       "shield and smote him on the thigh. The coat of mail did not stay it, but\n",
       "that it made a grisly wound, and the stout knight tottered with the\n",
       "blow, even as an old oak, withered and sapless, rocks with every blast\n",
       "of the wind. Nor did Cambell fail to use the occasion. He smote him yet\n",
       "again upon the side, making another deadly wound, and though the spear\n",
       "brake with the blow, he did not abate his onset, but drave the shaft\n",
       "through the visor of Sir Priamond’s helmet, and laid him low upon the\n",
       "ground. So fell the first of the three brothers; yet did not his soul\n",
       "depart, but by virtue of the gift of the Fates it passed into the bodies\n",
       "of the two that yet remained, making them stronger and more eager for\n",
       "the fray.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nevertheless, when Sir Diamond addressed himself to the battle, the\n",
       "lists having been cleared afresh, and the trumpet sounded a second time,\n",
       "he fared no better than his brother. For a while the two stood face to\n",
       "face, giving and receiving equal blows, but without advantage either to\n",
       "the one or to the other. But then a great gust of wrath swept through\n",
       "Sir Diamond’s soul, driving away all thought but of how he might most\n",
       "speedily avenge his brother. And, indeed, the very soul of the brother\n",
       "stirred within him. So he lifted high his mighty battle-axe, swinging it\n",
       "over his head, and bringing it down on his adversary with all the force\n",
       "that was in his body. And, surely, had the blow fallen as it was meant,\n",
       "there had been an end of strife. No magic ring had availed to stay so\n",
       "dreadful an onset. It had crushed out Sir Cambell’s life, whether with\n",
       "or without the shedding of blood. But fortune helped him in his need,\n",
       "for judging where the axe would fall, he swerved aside, so that the\n",
       "stroke missed the mark, and the striker’s right foot slid from under\n",
       "him. So we may see a hawk strike at a heron with all his might; so\n",
       "strong is the blow, that it would seem as if nothing could turn it\n",
       "aside; but the heron, a wary bird, sees it come, and lightly avoids it,\n",
       "so that the hawk is well-nigh brought to the ground ere the force of his\n",
       "onset is sped. So fared it with Sir Diamond; not only so, but while he\n",
       "reached forward with his left arm to recover himself, he left his side\n",
       "unguarded by the shield. Which thing Sir Cambell did not fail to\n",
       "perceive, for swinging his axe, he smote him between the topmost rings\n",
       "of the coat of mail and the lowest rings of the helmet, which spot is\n",
       "ever dangerous to the warrior, how well soever he be armed. There did\n",
       "Sir Cambell smite Sir Diamond, with an arm so sure and deadly that he\n",
       "shore his head from his body.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now ensued the fiercest fight of all, yea, and also the strangest.\n",
       "Well might a man wonder to see how Sir Cambell stood up, neither faint\n",
       "nor weary, for all that he had been changing blows for the space of an\n",
       "hour and more. Yet did he seem even fresher and brighter than at his\n",
       "first taking of arms, just as some great serpent wakes from the long\n",
       "sleep of winter, when the warm breath of spring has touched him, and\n",
       "throws off the ragged skin of his old estate, and raises himself in the\n",
       "sunshine with all the glory of his youth renewed. Such freshness and\n",
       "vigour did the magic ring work in calling out all the strength that he\n",
       "had, for all the magic in the world had not availed to help a coward or\n",
       "a sluggard. Against him stood a worthy foe, with the might of three\n",
       "stout champions in his heart and in his limbs. Once and again, yea, many\n",
       "times, did it seem that this or that warrior had prevailed. Now was\n",
       "Cambell beaten to his knee, till all the company thought he must needs\n",
       "lose the day, and now was Triamond stretched upon the ground, like to\n",
       "one who has received a mortal wound. And once, indeed, the two lay\n",
       "together at full length, as though they had been dead. The judges rose\n",
       "from their place, and the marshals of the lists came forward as to carry\n",
       "the two corpses to the appointed place, and the fair Canacé cried out in\n",
       "her despair, for it seemed as if both brother and lover had been taken\n",
       "from her at once. But lo! in a moment the two were standing on their\n",
       "feet again, and addressing themselves anew to the battle. What had been\n",
       "the end, whether the virtue of the magic ring had overcome the triple\n",
       "might of him in whom dwelt the spirits of three brave men, who can say?\n",
       "For now there was heard such a clamour, such a confusion of voices, such\n",
       "a shouting of men and wailing of women and shrill crying of children,\n",
       "that all turned their faces to look, and the two champions by common\n",
       "consent stayed their hands till they could see what strange things had\n",
       "happened. And, indeed, it was a marvellous sight that they saw. There\n",
       "came speeding along the ground, fast as a thunder-cloud that rides the\n",
       "sky, a chariot richly adorned with gold and purple in the Persian\n",
       "fashion. Two lions from the forest drew it, mighty beasts, such as could\n",
       "not be surpassed for strength and fierceness in any land, but now they\n",
       "had forgotten their savageness to obey the pleasure of their driver. And\n",
       "this was a lady of wonderful beauty, and not less wise than fair, for\n",
       "she had been taught all the arts of wholesome magic by the fairy, her\n",
       "mother. In her right hand she carried a wand with two serpents twined\n",
       "about it, and in her left a cup filled to the brim with nepenthe, the\n",
       "wondrous drink of which he that tastes straightway forgets all grief and\n",

       "brother stood, came to his help. All the people made a way for her to\n",
       "pass, so that she could approach the lists. These first she struck with\n",
       "her wand, and they fell at the stroke. Then she said to the two\n",
       "champions, “Cease now your strife and be at peace.” And when they would\n",
       "not hear, but made as if to renew the battle, she cast herself upon her\n",
       "knees and besought them with many prayers and tears to cease from their\n",
       "anger; and when they still hardened their hearts, she smote them lightly\n",
       "with her wand. So soon as they felt the touch, the swords dropped from\n",
       "their hands. Then, as they stood astonished, not knowing what had\n",
       "befallen them, she gave the cup first to one and then to the other; and\n",
       "they, as being consumed by mighty thirst, drank each a mighty draught.\n",
       "Straightway the magic liquor turned all their strife to love; they\n",
       "clasped hands, and plighted troth to each other, and swore that they\n",
       "would be friends for ever. And such indeed they were to the end of their\n",

       "                         THE STORY OF FLORIMELL\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "It has been related before how Sir Guyon and Prince Arthur parted\n",
       "company with Britomart with the purpose of relieving a fair lady in\n",
       "distress. Now the name of this same lady was Florimell. She was courted\n",
       "by many knights of high degree, but her love was given to Sir Marinell,\n",
       "the same that was overthrown by Britomart in the passage by the sea; but\n",
       "he, on his part, had no thought for her, being mindful of his mother’s\n",
       "counsel that he should hold himself aloof from all womankind. So fast\n",
       "did Florimell fly, for she was in grievous fear, that the two knights\n",
       "who followed with intent to give her help, could by no means overtake\n",
       "her. After a while the strength of the white palfrey on which she rode\n",
       "wholly gave out, and she, alighting, made her way on foot, a thing which\n",
       "she had never done in all her life before, so delicately bred was she.\n",
       "But need teaches many lessons, this being chief among them, that Fortune\n",
       "holds the lots of all in equal scales, and has no respect of persons. So\n",
       "travelling, she came to a hillside, from which, looking down, she espied\n",
       "a valley thickly covered with trees, and through the tree-tops a thin\n",
       "vapour of smoke issuing forth. “Here,” she said to herself, “is a\n",
       "dwelling of man, where haply I may find shelter and rest.” So she bent\n",
       "her steps thither, and after a while reached the place, being now sorely\n",
       "spent with trouble and weariness. A dwelling there was, but of the\n",
       "humblest kind, a little cottage, built with reeds and wattled with sods\n",
       "of grass. In this there dwelt a witch woman. Most sparely did she live,\n",
       "careless of all common things, for her mind was wholly given to her art,\n",
       "for the better and more secure practice of which she lived far from all\n",
       "neighbours.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Florimell came in the witch was sitting on the ground, and was so\n",
       "busied with one of her enchantments that she was taken wholly unawares.\n",
       "At the first she was overcome with fear, for she would not that any\n",
       "should surprise her while she was busy with her art. Then, her fear\n",
       "changing to anger, as, indeed, it is commonly wont to do, she cried in a\n",
       "loud voice: “Stranger, what mischief has brought you hither? Here, of a\n",
       "truth, you will find no welcome.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Florimell answered: “Mother, be not angry with a simple maid, who has\n",
       "been brought to your dwelling by hard chance, and asks only for leave to\n",
       "rest awhile.” And as she spoke the tears came trickling down her cheeks,\n",
       "and she heaved a sigh, so softly and sweetly, that there could be no\n",
       "creature so hard and savage that would not have pitied her. Even the\n",
       "witch, for all that her soul was given to mischief, was much moved at\n",
       "the sight, and sought to comfort her in such rude fashion as she knew,\n",
       "for even in her the sight of such beauty and virtue moved the hidden\n",
       "sense of womanhood. So, wiping the tears from the damsel’s eyes, she\n",
       "bade her rest awhile. This she was nothing loath to do, and sat down\n",
       "upon the dusty floor, as a bird spent with tempest cowers upon the\n",
       "ground. After a while she began to set aright the garments that she\n",
       "wore, and to put in order her golden hair. All this the witch woman saw\n",
       "with wonder that still waxed greater and greater. “Is this a mortal\n",
       "maid,” she said to herself, “or one of Diana’s train?”\n",
       "\n",
       "This same witch woman had a son, very dear to her, and in a sort the\n",
       "comfort of her age, but a lazy, evil-minded loon, always idling away his\n",
       "time, and loath to follow any honest trade. He was abroad when Florimell\n",
       "came to the cottage, and when he returned, he was not a little amazed to\n",
       "see so fair a creature sitting by his mother’s hearth. But the maiden\n",
       "bore herself so meekly, fitting herself to the low condition of the\n",
       "place, that she soon ceased to be strange to mother and son. This was a\n",
       "thing to be desired; yet it had in it this discomfort, that the witch’s\n",
       "son began to love her. He would bring gifts for her, such as birds which\n",
       "he taught to speak her name, and squirrels which, he said, were as\n",
       "fellow-slaves with himself, and flowers to make garlands for her head.\n",
       "All these she graciously received. Nevertheless she was not a little\n",
       "troubled in her heart, for she could not but perceive the love which the\n",
       "young man bore her. Therefore she determined in herself to depart.\n",
       "\n",
       "By this time her palfrey was well rested from its weariness, for,\n",
       "indeed, the young man, the son of the witch, had tended it with all\n",
       "care. Early, therefore, one morning she put its strappings on the beast,\n",
       "and so departed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Great was the anger of the witch and her son when they knew that\n",
       "Florimell was gone. As for the disappointed lover, his fury passed all\n",
       "bounds. He beat upon his breast and scratched his face, and tore his\n",
       "flesh with his teeth. When his mother saw him in so evil a plight, she\n",
       "did all that she could to comfort him. Tears and prayers she used, and\n",
       "charms and herbs of might; but all were of no avail. When she saw this,\n",
       "fearing lest, in his despair, he should bring himself to a violent end,\n",
       "she said within herself: “I must bring the creature back.” So she called\n",
       "out of the cave a hideous beast that served her. It was a creature\n",
       "likest to a hyena, for its back and sides were covered with spots. But\n",
       "never was seen anything that could be matched with it, so fierce of\n",
       "aspect was it, and so swift. The witch said to him: “Follow this woman,\n",
       "and do not leave following till you overtake.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So the monster followed Florimell, and, as she rode leisurely, soon\n",
       "overtook her. When she saw him, she set spurs to her palfrey, and he, so\n",
       "long as he was fresh and full of breath, kept her out of the creature’s\n",
       "reach. But when his breath failed him, then the monster drew near. This\n",
       "Florimell perceiving, leapt from her saddle and fled away on her feet.\n",
       "Now it chanced that she was close to the seashore, and she, being minded\n",
       "to be drowned, rather than be overtaken by so foul a beast, ran to the\n",
       "very edge of the waves. There, by good hap, she saw a little shallop\n",
       "lying, in which the fisherman, an old man and poor, lay asleep, the\n",
       "while his nets were drying. Into this she leapt, and pushing off the\n",
       "shallop with an oar, was safe awhile. The monster would not venture on\n",
       "the sea, for it was not to his liking, and so set out to return to his\n",
       "mistress the witch, to tell her how his quest had failed. But first he\n",
       "turned upon the palfrey and rent it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Scarcely had the beast done this, when there came that way a gallant\n",
       "knight, Sir Satyrane by name, the same that had befriended the Lady Una\n",
       "in her distress. He, seeing the palfrey lie dead upon the ground, knew\n",
       "it for that on which the Lady Florimell had been wont to ride; also he\n",
       "found the golden girdle which she had been wont to wear, for it had\n",
       "fallen from her in the haste of her flight. These things greatly\n",
       "troubled him, and when, looking round, he also saw the monstrous beast\n",
       "which had pursued her, standing by, his fear was changed to anger, and\n",
       "he flew upon it and dealt it many blows with all his might. Many wounds\n",
       "did he give it, causing much blood to pour out of its carcase; but the\n",
       "beast he subdued not, with such spells had the witch woman fortified it\n",
       "against all assault. At the last he threw away his sword, for in truth\n",
       "the steel seemed to avail nothing against the creature’s hide, and\n",
       "caught it in his arms as if he would have crushed the life out of it;\n",
       "also he took the girdle of Florimell and bound the beast with it. Never\n",
       "in truth had it known such constraint, for in a moment all its rage was\n",
       "quelled, and it followed him meek as a lamb which the shepherd has\n",
       "rescued from the lion’s mouth. And this, without doubt, it had continued\n",
       "to do, but for this chance, that Sir Satyrane was called away upon\n",
       "another adventure. He spied a giantess riding on a dappled grey steed,\n",
       "holding before her a squire fast bound with chains of wire, and a knight\n",
       "pursuing her. Therefore he made haste to put himself in her way. She\n",
       "would have passed him by, but he would not suffer it, running at her\n",
       "with his spear. Thereupon she was constrained to deal with him, and\n",
       "would have smitten him with a great mace of iron which she carried in\n",
       "her hand, and with which she had already slain not a few. But ere she\n",
       "could deal the blow, his spear came full upon her shield. So great was\n",
       "the shock, that her horse staggered to and fro; but she was not moved\n",
       "one whit in her place, nor was the shield broken. Rather the shaft of\n",
       "the spear was shivered on it, for all it was big and strong. Nor did she\n",
       "delay to strike him with the mace of iron. Full on his helmet’s crest\n",
       "she smote him, and that so sturdily that he bowed his head upon his\n",
       "breast and reeled to and fro like to a drunken man. Which the giantess\n",
       "perceiving, caught him in her arms, and put him on the saddle before\n",
       "her, for the squire she had already cast to the ground. Then truly had\n",
       "Sir Satyrane been in an evil plight, but for the knight that was\n",
       "pursuing. He, indeed, seeing what had chanced, made the greater haste to\n",
       "overtake her, but she, not desiring another battle, or because she\n",
       "especially feared the other knight, threw Sir Satyrane to the ground,\n",
       "and thus he was delivered. But meanwhile the witch’s monster had\n",
       "departed.\n",

       "The monster sped on as fast as it could to the dwelling of its mistress,\n",
       "the witch woman. When she saw it, she perceived how it was bound with\n",
       "Florimell’s girdle. At this she rejoiced greatly, and showed the thing\n",
       "to her son, thinking that he also would rejoice. “See,” said she, “this\n",
       "thankless creature has not escaped. Behold her girdle.”\n",
       "\n",
       "But he was otherwise minded. “Surely,” he cried, “she is dead, this\n",
       "fairest of all maidens!” And it seemed as if he would have torn the very\n",
       "heart out of his breast. So mad was he with anger and grief, that he\n",
       "would have slain his mother where she stood. Only she hid herself in a\n",
       "secret place where she was wont to call up the evil spirits which served\n",
       "her. And now she summoned them to her help, telling them what had come\n",

       "and grief and love, and either he will lay violent hands on himself, or\n",
       "he will slay me, though I have done my very best to serve and help him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So the spirits took counsel together in the matter, and by their advice,\n",
       "her own wicked wit helping, she contrived a marvellous thing. She set\n",
       "herself to make another Florimell, a false maid, like in all things to\n",
       "the true, so far as concerned shape and outward semblance. The substance\n",
       "of which she made her was snow, which she gathered in a secret glade of\n",
       "the Thracian hills, the spirits of the mountains having revealed to her\n",
       "the place. This snow she tempered with fine mercury and virgin wax,\n",
       "which had never been touched with fire. These she mingled with\n",
       "vermilion, so making a rosy red in the cheeks. And for eyes she set two\n",
       "lamps, whose fire was marvellously attempered to the likeness of life;\n",
       "and hair she made of golden wire, more marvellously light than ever was\n",
       "hair of woman; and for life to make this dead mass move and breathe—for\n",
       "dead it was for all its beauty—she put one of the spirits which served\n",
       "her. A wicked spirit was this, none more wicked or crafty, or with a\n",
       "more cunning art to take the semblance of goodness. There was no need to\n",
       "teach him how to bear himself. This he knew already; there was no\n",
       "subtlety or craft in all the wit of woman with which he was not\n",
       "acquainted. Such was the false Florimell.\n",
       "\n",
       "This creature she arrayed in some of the garments which the true\n",
       "Florimell had left behind her, and so brought her to her son, where he\n",
       "lay groaning on the earth. “See, my son,” she said, “the maid herself\n",
       "has come back to us.” And when he saw her, he leapt from the ground, and\n",
       "would have caught her in his arms. But she held back, for the spirit\n",
       "within her knew well how women bear themselves in such a case, neither\n",
       "seeming too fond, yet giving such encouragement as might the more\n",
       "confirm him in his passion. Such was the charge which the witch woman\n",
       "laid upon him.\n",
       "\n",
       "One day, as the son was walking with the false Florimell in the wood,\n",
       "there chanced to come by a certain knight with a squire attending him.\n",
       "And now it must be said who this fellow was, for, indeed, he was no true\n",
       "knight. It has been already told how that Sir Guyon, when he was helping\n",
       "a traveller in distress, had his horse and his spear also stolen from\n",
       "him. The thing was done by a vain fellow, Bragadocchio by name, who,\n",
       "seeing the horse and spear ready to his hand, thought that by taking\n",
       "them he might make himself into a veritable knight. Little had he of his\n",
       "own but a ready tongue; but this same tongue was no small help with the\n",
       "more foolish sort. He then, mounting the steed, and taking the spear in\n",
       "hand, rode on, and so vain was he, and full of self-conceit, that he\n",
       "hoped to be courteously received for what he seemed to be. And in this\n",
       "notion his first adventure confirmed him. As he rode along he saw a man\n",
       "sitting idly on a bank; and he said to himself: “Here is one whom I will\n",
       "make captive to my spear.” With that he smote his steed upon the flank,\n",
       "and set his spear in rest and charged. The man, when he saw him coming\n",
       "on, fell flat on the ground for fear, and cried for mercy, holding up\n",
       "his hands. At this Bragadocchio took a wonderful conceit of his own\n",
       "strength and courage: “Who are you, caitiff?” he cried. “You are not\n",
       "worthy to breathe the air along with honest men. Prepare for death, or\n",
       "yield yourself to be my prisoner for ever. ’Tis no small favour that I\n",
       "give you time to answer!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The man cried: “Hold your death-dealing hand, my lord, I am your\n",
       "thrall!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“So be it,” said the sham knight, “your fate has baulked my will, and\n",
       "given you life when I had purposed death. So be it; life I give you.\n",
       "Fall on the ground, and kiss my stirrup. So pay your homage.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then the wretch threw himself on the ground, and kissed the stirrup, and\n",
       "declared himself to be Bragadocchio’s man. For a while he held his\n",
       "master in great respect, but when he found out how hollow was his show\n",
       "of courage, then he grew bolder, and practised upon him for his own\n",
       "ends. Trompart was his name, which, being interpreted, means deceiver; a\n",
       "worthy squire he was for such a knight.\n",
       "\n",
       "They had not long companied together when they chanced to meet\n",
       "Archimage, who was looking out for some men-at-arms to help him in his\n",
       "evil designs. He, coming close to Trompart, said to him under his\n",
       "breath: “Who is this mighty warrior, who has a spear only and no sword?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Said Trompart: “He is indeed a mighty warrior; as for his sword, he has\n",
       "made a vow that he will use none till he shall be avenged for a certain\n",
       "wrong that has been done to him. Meanwhile his spear is enough: he can\n",
       "do to death with that as many as he will.” Then Archimage, louting low\n",
       "before him, told a false tale about the Red-Cross Knight and Sir Guyon,\n",
       "which when Bragadocchio had heard, he cried with a loud voice: “Old man,\n",
       "tell me where these false knights are hiding themselves. I will soon\n",
       "punish them for all their misdeeds.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“That will I do without delay,” answered Archimage, “and will help you\n",
       "also when you come to deal with them. Meanwhile I would give you this\n",
       "counsel, that you give no odds to your adversaries, but provide yourself\n",
       "with a sword before you do battle with them, for, indeed, they are\n",
       "sturdy fighters.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Old man,” said Bragadocchio, “you dote. Doubtless your wits have failed\n",
       "you by reason of age, or you would not judge of a man by his coat of\n",
       "mail or his sword. A man, be he indeed a man, can quell a host without\n",
       "sword or shield. Little do you know what this right hand of mine has\n",
       "achieved; but they who have seen it can tell if they will.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Not a little abashed was Archimage at these high words; well he knew in\n",
       "his heart that whoso should do battle with the Red-Cross Knight or Sir\n",
       "Guyon would need all his arms, and yet he feared to offend this knight.\n",
       "Then Bragadocchio said further: “Once upon a time I slew seven knights\n",
       "with one sword. And I took a great oath, having done this, never again\n",
       "to use a sword in battle, unless it should be the sword of the very\n",
       "noblest knight in all the world.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Wait you for that,” said Archimage, “then you shall have it by\n",
       "to-morrow at this time. ’Tis the sword of Prince Arthur, and it flames\n",
       "like a burning fire. Lo! I go to fetch it.” And as he spoke he vanished\n",
       "into air.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What is this?” thought the two to themselves in sore dismay, for they\n",
       "liked little to have aught to do with such a sword. And they fled from\n",
       "the place as fast as they could to hide themselves in a wood which was\n",
       "near at hand. This they had scarcely reached when they heard the clear\n",
       "ringing of a horn. Thereupon Bragadocchio leapt from his horse and hid\n",
       "his coward head in a thicket. As for Trompart, he was not easily moved,\n",
       "but abode in his place to see what should happen. Soon there came into\n",
       "the glade where they were a very fair lady dressed in huntress fashion.\n",
       "She had a fair white tunic with an edge of gold and gilded buskins, and\n",
       "a boar-spear in her hand, and on her shoulder a bow and a quiver filled\n",
       "with steel-headed arrows. And all about them flowed loosely down her\n",
       "golden hair. When she spied Trompart she said: “Saw you a hind with an\n",
       "arrow in her right haunch? If so, tell me which way she went, that I may\n",
       "follow up the chase.” But while she was speaking, she saw the bush stir\n",
       "in which Bragadocchio lay hid, and thinking it was some beast of prey,\n",
       "would have shot an arrow into it.\n",
       "\n",
       "But Trompart cried: “Forbear, I pray you, whether you be nymph or mortal\n",
       "maid. That is no mark for your arrows. My master, a famous knight, rests\n",
       "awhile under the shade.” So she stayed her hand, and Bragadocchio came\n",
       "forth from his hiding-place on his hands and knees, and after stood up,\n",
       "making as if he had been newly roused from sleep. After this they talked\n",
       "awhile, and when the lady had passed on, Bragadocchio said to Trompart:\n",
       "“I had from my birth this grace, not to fear any mortal thing. But of\n",
       "the heavenly powers and of the fiends in hell I do stand, I do honestly\n",
       "confess, in great dread. And when I heard that horn, I took it for some\n",
       "signal from the sky, and hid myself for fear. And now let us depart\n",
       "hence.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Such was Bragadocchio, the false knight who came upon the son of the\n",
       "witch woman as he was walking in the wood with the false Florimell. When\n",
       "he saw the two, and perceived that the lady was very fair to look upon,\n",
       "and that he who was with her was no man of war, he rode up, with his\n",
       "spear in rest, crying, “Clown, how is this? This lady is my love.\n",
       "Gainsay it if you dare!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The churl dare not answer him a word, but yielded the damsel to him; and\n",
       "he, mounting her upon Trompart’s horse, rode on, not a little proud of\n",
       "the valiant deed which he had done. Nor had he ridden long when there\n",
       "came in view a stranger knight, who cried: “Ho there! Yield the damsel\n",
       "to me; I have a better right than you!”\n",
       "\n",
       "Sorely dismayed was Bragadocchio at such a challenge, but dissembled his\n",
       "fear, saying, “Think you, Sir Knight, to steal away with words what I\n",
       "have won by many blows? Yet, if you will have trial of my strength or\n",
       "prove your own, let it be so.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Turn your horse,” said the stranger, “or I will strike you dead!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“So be it,” answered Bragadocchio, “if nothing else will content you.\n",
       "Let us then retire our horses for a furlong either way, and tilt\n",
       "together as is the custom.” So they turned their horses, and retired\n",
       "each a furlong’s length; but Bragadocchio came not again, but fled away\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "By sundry adventures, which there is no need to set forth in their\n",
       "place, the girdle of Florimell came into the possession of Sir Satyrane,\n",
       "who forthwith resolved to hold in honour of it a great tournament. In\n",
       "this same tournament there should be, so he proclaimed, two contests;\n",
       "first, a contest of knights, who should joust with each other, so\n",
       "showing who excelled in strength and courage; second, a contest of fair\n",
       "ladies, she who should most fittingly wear the said girdle being\n",
       "adjudged the most excellent.\n",
       "\n",
       "The beginning of the tournament was that Sir Satyrane came forth from\n",
       "his pavilion, holding in his hands an ark of gold. This ark he opened\n",
       "with much solemnity, and drew forth from it the girdle. A wondrously\n",
       "fair thing it was, curiously embossed with pearls and precious stones;\n",
       "they were all costly things, but the workmanship was costlier yet. This\n",
       "he held up for the general view; and all eyes were drawn to it, for\n",
       "indeed it was a thing greatly to be admired; nor was there one in all\n",
       "that company but said in his heart: “Happy the knight who shall win so\n",
       "fair a prize! Happy the dame who shall be deemed to wear it most\n",
       "fittingly.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The girdle having been thus displayed in the sight of all the concourse,\n",
       "the knights disposed themselves for the jousting. And first of all Sir\n",
       "Satyrane came forth holding in his hand the great spear which he was\n",
       "wont to wield; no man in those days bore one greater, or, indeed, so\n",
       "great. He was the challenger, and it became him thus to be first in the\n",
       "field. Behind him were ranged the knights of Fairyland, owning\n",
       "allegiance, all of them, to the great Queen Gloriana. On the other side\n",
       "was ranged a great company of knights, who had come from all parts.\n",
       "First of these rode up a pagan knight, Sir Bruncheval, surnamed the Bold\n",
       "(he jousted with Sir Satyrane), whose mastery of arms had been tried in\n",
       "many battles. Fierce was their onset, so fierce that neither could\n",
       "resist the other; but both were tumbled on the plain, holding, indeed,\n",
       "their spears in their hands, but not able to move them so much as a\n",
       "hair’s-breadth. When Sir Ferramont saw his leader in this plight, he set\n",
       "spurs to his horse, and rode forth. Against him came out Sir Blandamour,\n",
       "putting all his strength into his stroke; but his strength availed him\n",
       "nothing, for he was tumbled on the ground, he and his horse together.\n",
       "And when Sir Paridell rode forth to his rescue, he fared no better. The\n",
       "next in turn to contend was Bragadocchio, but the thing was not to his\n",
       "liking, and he stood still in doubt what he should do, or rather in\n",
       "fear. Thereupon Sir Triamond, vexed indeed that a brave-seeming knight\n",
       "should bear himself so basely, but rejoicing in the occasion, rode forth\n",
       "with his spear in rest, and charged on Sir Ferramont with all his might.\n",
       "So sure was the stroke, that both man and horse were laid prostrate on\n",
       "the ground, nor could they lift themselves again for a space. And when\n",
       "Sir Devon rode forth from the Fairyland array he fared no better; nor\n",
       "did Sir Douglas, nor Sir Palimord, when in turn they made trial of him.\n",
       "Either they were stretched on the plain or went sorely wounded.\n",
       "\n",
       "By this time Sir Satyrane had woke out of the swoon in which he had lain\n",
       "so long. Looking round, he was sorely dismayed to see the havoc which\n",
       "Sir Triamond had wrought among the knights of Queen Gloriana. “Truly,”\n",
       "he said to himself, “I had rather been dead than laid here helpless\n",
       "while such deeds were done.” Then, gathering strength, he laid hold of\n",
       "his spear, which lay close beside him; his horse also, by good fortune,\n",
       "was at hand. Mounting, therefore, he rode forth again to where the brave\n",
       "Triamond was carrying all before him. Not a man could stand up against\n",
       "him, so heavy were his strokes, so deadly was his hand. But now there\n",
       "came a stay to his achievements; Sir Satyrane smote him on the side with\n",
       "his great spear, and the point made a most grievous wound. So grievous\n",
       "was it, that though he was not forthwith overthrown, he was fain to\n",
       "withdraw himself from the field. Then the challengers ranged over the\n",
       "lists, claiming to be conquerors, and, indeed, no one was ready to take\n",
       "them in hand. And now the night fell, and the trumpets sounded a\n",
       "retreat. That day, therefore, Sir Satyrane was adjudged to have won the\n",
       "prize.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the second day of the tournament Sir Satyrane rode forth, with Queen\n",
       "Gloriana’s knights following him, to challenge all comers. And on the\n",
       "other side also were many famous warriors, eager all of them to win the\n",
       "prize for himself. But Sir Triamond was not one of these; his wound was\n",
       "so grievous that it hindered him from making a trial of arms. So he was\n",
       "constrained to stand aside, but it grieved him sorely. This his close\n",
       "friend Sir Cambell perceiving, said to himself: “I cannot cure his hurt,\n",
       "nor undo the thing which has been done; but this I can do; I can win\n",
       "honour for him.” Therefore he took Sir Triamond’s arms, none knowing,\n",
       "neither Sir Triamond himself, nor anyone else, for he said to himself:\n",
       "“If I fare ill in this matter, the blame will not fall on my friend.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He went therefore to fight, no one doubting that he was the veritable\n",
       "Triamond. When he was come, he found Sir Satyrane, full of joy and\n",
       "triumph, for no one was able to stand up against him. At him, therefore,\n",
       "he charged, with his spear in rest; nor did Sir Satyrane, on his part,\n",
       "draw back from the encounter. With so great a shock did they meet that\n",
       "both were driven from their saddles to the ground. Rising, therefore,\n",
       "they drew both of them their swords, and fought therewith such a fight\n",
       "as had scarce been seen before in that land. And now Sir Satyrane’s\n",
       "horse, for, by this time, they had both again mounted their steeds,\n",
       "chanced to stumble, so that his rider was well-nigh cast to the ground.\n",
       "This Sir Cambell perceiving, was not slow to seize the occasion, but\n",
       "dealt him so sore a blow on the crest of his helmet that he fell to the\n",
       "ground. Then Sir Cambell leapt from his steed, and would have spoiled\n",
       "him of his arms. But this, which, indeed, is a custom of the battlefield\n",
       "rather than of the tourney, the knights who were of Sir Satyrane’s party\n",
       "would not suffer. Hastening to their comrade’s help, they closed his\n",
       "adversary in so close a ring that though he laid about him most bravely,\n",
       "yet could he not deliver himself—for what could one against so many? So\n",
       "he was taken prisoner and led away.\n",
       "\n",
       "It chanced somehow that the news of what had befallen Sir Cambell came\n",
       "to Sir Triamond where he lay in his bed. In a moment of time he leapt\n",
       "therefrom, wholly forgetting his wound, and sought for his armour. He\n",
       "sought, but he found it not, for indeed, Cambell was wearing it at the\n",
       "very time. But the arms and armour of Sir Cambell he found. These he\n",
       "donned without delay, and issued forth to take such chance as might\n",
       "befall him. There he saw his friend and companion Cambell as he was led\n",
       "away captive in the midst of a great press of knights, and the sight\n",
       "moved him to great wrath. He thrust himself into the thickest of the\n",
       "press, and smote down all that were in his way till he came to where\n",
       "Cambell was led a prisoner between two knights. Fiercely did he assail\n",
       "these two, and they, for their own lives’ sake, were constrained to let\n",
       "him go. Then he, seizing a sword from one of them, laid about him with\n",
       "all his might, for both his own wrong and the wounding of his friend\n",
       "stirred a great wrath in him. So these two made great havoc over all the\n",
       "field, till the trumpet sounded the end of the battle for that day. By\n",
       "common consent the prize of the day was adjudged to these two, Cambell\n",
       "and Triamond, but to which of the two was doubtful, for they strove\n",
       "together, each advancing the other’s cause, so that the matter was\n",
       "postponed.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the third and last day of the tournament many valiant deeds were\n",
       "done, not without great hurt and damage to many that contended in the\n",
       "field. There might be seen that day full many a shivered shield, and\n",
       "swords strewn upon the ground, horses also running loose without their\n",
       "riders, and squires helping their lords who were in evil plight. But,\n",
       "for the most part, the knights of the Queen fared the better, and among\n",
       "the knights there was not one that fought with better success than the\n",
       "brave Sir Satyrane. Now and again his fortune failed him; but ever it\n",
       "returned again, and he was the best stay and support of his side.\n",
       "\n",
       "But when it was now past noon, there came forth from the other side a\n",
       "strange knight whom no one knew. Strange he was and strange was his\n",
       "disguise, for all his armour was covered with moss from the wood, and\n",
       "his horse had trappings of oak leaves, and on his shield, which had\n",
       "ragged edges, was written this motto: _Salvagesse sans Finesse_. He, as\n",
       "soon as he had come upon the field, charged the first knight that was in\n",
       "his way. This was the stout Sir Sanglier, a valiant man, well approved\n",
       "in many battles; but now he was laid low at the very first encounter.\n",
       "And after him Sir Brianor came to a worse fate, for he was killed\n",
       "outright. Seven knights, one after the other, he overthrew; and when his\n",
       "spear was broken, then he worked no less damage with his sword. Shields\n",
       "and helmets he broke through, and wasted all the array of knights, as a\n",
       "lion wastes a flock of sheep. So Satyrane and his party were turned to\n",
       "flight, for, indeed, no man could stand before him. And when they would\n",
       "find out his name, no one knew it, so that they were constrained to call\n",
       "him the Savage Knight. But he was in truth Sir Artegall.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was said by a wise man of old time that no man should be accounted\n",
       "happy before the end, because it cannot be known what change of fortune\n",
       "may befall him. And so it proved that day with Sir Artegall. For when\n",
       "the sun was laid low in the heavens, but before the trumpet had sounded,\n",
       "there came forth from the ranks of the Queen’s knights a stranger. First\n",
       "he charged at Sir Artegall and tumbled him backwards over his horse’s\n",
       "tail, with so heavy a fall that he had small desire to rise again. This\n",
       "when Sir Cambell saw he charged with all his might; and he, too, could\n",
       "be seen lying on the plain. In like manner fared Sir Triamond when he\n",
       "would have avenged his friend’s disgrace. Nor did Sir Blandamour succeed\n",
       "where these had failed. Many another famous knight was overthrown that\n",
       "day, yet without loss of honour, for they had to yield to the enchanted\n",
       "spear of Britomart. So when the trumpet sounded on the third day of Sir\n",

       "there must needs be a trial of the dames, who should be reckoned the\n",
       "fairest, with the girdle of Florimell for prize.\n",
       "\n",
       "First came Sir Cambell, leading his wife, the fair Cambina, clad in a\n",
       "veil which covered her from head to foot, which being taken away, such\n",
       "was her beauty that all hearts were won. Nevertheless, when Sir\n",
       "Triamond, coming next, showed his wife Canacé, they were not less moved\n",
       "by the sight. And some greatly admired the false Duessa, when Sir\n",
       "Paridell led her forth before the company, for some hearts are moved by\n",
       "one thing and some by another. Nor did the Lady Lucida, whose champion\n",
       "was Sir Ferramont, want for worshippers; nor, indeed, did any one of the\n",
       "hundred dames assembled in that place, lack some to champion her. Yet,\n",
       "doubtless, the great number of the votes had been given to Amoret, when\n",
       "Britomart led her forth, but that she also was surpassed in the common\n",
       "judgment by Sir Blandamour’s Florimell, not the true Florimell, it must\n",
       "be understood, but the false which the witch woman had made. For in\n",
       "comparison of her all others seemed but base, even as the stars seem to\n",
       "grow dull when the moon is shining at her full. “This,” said they all,\n",
       "“is no mortal creature, but an angel from heaven.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Even so when some cunning smith overlays base metal with covering of\n",
       "gold, he lays upon it so fair a gloss that it seems to surpass the true\n",
       "gold itself. So they who had looked upon the true Florimell thought to\n",
       "themselves, “The dame is fairer than ever before!” For ever it is that\n",
       "false things do seem to excel the true, so weak and false are the\n",
       "judgments of men.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then, by common consent, the girdle was adjudged to her as being the\n",
       "fairest of all; but lo! when they thought to bind it round her waist,\n",
       "they could not prevail to do it. So soon as they fastened it, it seemed\n",
       "to loose itself and fall away, as if there was some secret hindrance and\n",
       "want of fitness. And so it fared with many other dames when they assayed\n",
       "the same; when they would have girt the thing about their waists, they\n",
       "could not. However fast it seemed to be, it was soon seen to be loose.\n",
       "Then a certain squire, who thought scorn of women, cried aloud: “Surely\n",
       "this is a sorrowful sight, that out of so many fair dames not one can\n",
       "fit to herself the girdle of beauty! Shame on the man who thought of\n",
       "this fatal device! May he never find fair lady to love him!” At which\n",
       "saying all the knights laughed loud, and all the ladies frowned.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now the gentle Amoret, coming last of all that company, took the\n",
       "girdle in her hands, and put it around her waist, and lo! it fitted to a\n",
       "marvel. But the false Florimell snatched it away as if in anger, and\n",
       "would have clasped it round her own waist. She clasped it, but it fitted\n",
       "as ill as before. Nevertheless it was adjudged to her as her right, for\n",
       "such the common voice had been; and she herself was assigned to the\n",
       "Knight of the Ebony Spear, that is, to Britomart. But she was\n",
       "ill-content: “Nay, nay,” she said, all thinking that it was the Knight\n",
       "of the Ebony Spear that spoke, “I am no light of love; I am still\n",
       "steadfast to my own Amoret.” Then she was adjudged to the Savage Knight,\n",
       "but he had already departed in great wrath; and then to Triamond, but he\n",
       "was faithful to his Canacé; and after Triamond to Sir Satyrane. He\n",
       "indeed was well content. But then arose great strife, and, like enough,\n",
       "there had been a drawing of swords, but for this strange happening. Sir\n",

       "Britomart grew not a little weary of these strivings of knights and\n",
       "dames. Therefore she departed, taking with her the Lady Amoret, for she\n",
       "was still bent on finding the Knight of the Mirror. An unlucky maid she\n",
       "was, in truth, thus seeking one who had been her adversary, to whom she\n",
       "had been so near, though she knew it not. Great was her grief, and great\n",
       "also her toil, for neither grief nor toil did she spare, thinking that\n",
       "could she find him, there would be both an end of her own toil and a\n",
       "solace for her grief. The gentle Amoret also, who was her companion, had\n",
       "a sorrow of her own, for she sought for her Scudamore; but he, unhappy\n",
       "man, had his heart full of hatred and revenge. For that evil hag, whose\n",
       "name was Até or Strife, had poisoned it with suspicion. The very one who\n",
       "had best served him, he hated most, even Britomart. Neither could\n",
       "Glaucé, for she went with him, serving him as a squire, abate his rage,\n",
       "for all that she could say.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now, as though the evil counsels of Strife had not wrought trouble\n",
       "enough for him, he must needs put another burden on his soul. As they\n",
       "journeyed on, the night came upon them unawares, very heavy with cloud\n",
       "and rain. They, seeking some place where they might find shelter,\n",
       "perceived upon a steep hillside what seemed to be a poor man’s cottage.\n",
       "And underneath there ran a little stream, but the water was muddy and\n",
       "thick, and had an evil smell. As they came near they heard the sound of\n",
       "hammers, and judged that it must be a blacksmith’s forge. Entering in,\n",
       "they found the goodman of the place busy with his work. He was of a mean\n",
       "and wretched aspect, spent, it would seem, with weariness. His eyes were\n",
       "hollow, and his cheeks fallen in, like to one who had been many months\n",
       "in a prison cell; his face was begrimed with smoke and his beard ragged,\n",
       "as if neither comb nor shears had ever passed upon it. Rude were his\n",
       "garments, and hanging in rags, and his hands were blistered with\n",
       "burning, with nails long left unpared. Care was his name, and his trade\n",
       "was the working of wedges of iron. To what purpose they could serve,\n",
       "neither he nor anyone knew. Such are the idle doubts and fears which\n",
       "Care drives into the hearts of men. Nor was it he alone that was busy\n",
       "with this toil; six stout workers stood about the forge, all with huge\n",
       "hammers in their hands, which they plied in order. Much did Sir\n",
       "Scudamore wonder to see their work; but when he had watched it awhile,\n",
       "he asked them of its purpose, saying, “What make you?” But they answered\n",
       "not a word, nor did they hold their hands for a moment; the bellows blew\n",
       "like to a cold blast from the north, and the din of the hammers ceased\n",
       "not.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the knight saw that no one answered, he laid himself down upon the\n",
       "floor, seeking to rest his weary limbs; Glaucé did the like; and sore\n",
       "was her need of rest, for she was old and feeble, and they had journeyed\n",
       "that day a long and weary way. She slept indeed, but to Sir Scudamore\n",
       "there came no sleeping. Now he would lie on this side, now on that; now\n",
       "he lay in one place, now in another. Anon he would rise from his place,\n",
       "and then lie down again. But every change was to no purpose, and every\n",
       "place seemed full of pain. Also the dogs howled and barked all the night\n",
       "long, and the cocks crowed, and the owls hooted; and if by chance\n",
       "slumber came down upon his eyes, then one of the workers smote his\n",
       "headpiece with a hammer, for they indeed rested not all the night. As\n",
       "morning drew near, he fell into a sleep, so utterly wearied was he, but\n",

       "The next day Sir Scudamore and Glaucé, serving him as his squire,\n",

       "they had spent the night. After a while they espied a knight sitting\n",
       "beside a wood, while his horse grazed in the field hard by. The man\n",
       "mounted, so soon as he saw them, and rode forward, as did also Sir\n",
       "Scudamore. But when the two were near enough that each could discern\n",
       "what arms the other wore, the Knight of the Wood lowered his spear and\n",
       "turned his horse aside, saying, “Gentle Scudamore, pardon me, I pray\n",
       "you, that I had unknowingly almost trespassed against you!”\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "The other made answer: “I pray you pardon me if I withhold my name for a\n",

       "to call me the _Savage Knight_, for thus I am commonly known.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Scudamore said: “This place seems to suit well the arms which you\n",
       "are pleased to wear. But tell me, have you any special purpose to serve\n",
       "that you abide in this place?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Sir,” replied the other, “be it known to you that a stranger knight did\n",
       "me but the other day a great shame and dishonour, and I wait till I can\n",
       "take vengeance on him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Tell me,” answered Sir Scudamore, “who it is that wronged you.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“His name,” said the Savage Knight, “is unknown, yet he himself is known\n",
       "to many, especially by the ebony spear which he carries. It was but the\n",
       "other day that with this spear he overthrew all that met him in the\n",
       "tourney, and reft from me the honour of the day; not only so, for of\n",
       "these things a knight may not complain, but he took from me the fairest\n",
       "lady that ever was, and withholds her still.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Sir Scudamore knew that he spoke of Britomart, who, as he thought,\n",
       "had taken from him his love. All his heart was full of rage, and he\n",
       "cried out: “Now, by my head, this is not the first time of this knight’s\n",
       "playing an unknightly part, for I know him by this same spear which he\n",
       "bears. From me also did he carry away my love. If you purpose to take\n",
       "vengeance on him, I will give you all the help that I can.” So these two\n",
       "agreed to join together in wreaking their wrath on the Knight of the\n",
       "Ebony Spear, that is to say, on Britomart.\n",
       "\n",
       "While they were communing together on this matter, they saw in the\n",

       "the very one of whom they were speaking.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said Sir Scudamore: “I beseech you, Sir Savage Knight, that as I\n",

       "\n",
       "To this the other gave his assent. Thereupon Sir Scudamore charged at\n",
       "her with all his might and at his horse’s top speed, which she\n",
       "perceiving, made herself ready, and gave him so rough a welcome that she\n",
       "smote to the ground both horse and man; and this so strongly, that\n",
       "neither had any mind to rise therefrom. This Sir Artegall perceiving,\n",
       "felt in himself a yet greater anger than before, and laying his lance in\n",
       "rest, charged also with all his strength. But he also was laid upon the\n",
       "ground, for there was nothing that could withstand the enchanted spear.\n",
       "Nevertheless he fared better than his fellow, in that he rose lightly\n",
       "from the ground, and drawing his sword, leapt fiercely at his adversary.\n",
       "So sore were his strokes, that though she was on horseback, she was\n",
       "constrained to give place before him. As they turned this way and that,\n",
       "it chanced that a blow which Sir Artegall aimed at the Princess,\n",
       "glancing down the corslet which she wore, lighted on the back of her\n",
       "horse, wounding him so sorely upon the back, in the rear of the saddle,\n",
       "that she was compelled to alight. Not a whit was she dismayed at this\n",
       "mischance, and casting down her enchanted spear, betook herself to use\n",
       "sword and shield. And now the fortune of the fight changed somewhat, for\n",
       "he was not a little spent by long fighting on foot, and she, having been\n",
       "mounted hitherto, had the advantage. Hence it followed that she drove\n",
       "him backwards, and even, so heavy were her blows, wounded him through\n",
       "his coat of mail. And now behold! another change. She was over-hasty in\n",
       "her assault, and her breath began to fail; and he on the other hand\n",
       "reserved his strength, and dealt his blows as thick as the hailstones\n",
       "fall upon a roof—unhappy man, who came so near to slaying the fairest\n",
       "creature in all the world! Still was the battle waged between these two,\n",
       "but ever Sir Artegall grew the stronger and Britomart the weaker. At\n",
       "last he dealt a stroke that, had it been aimed aright, had surely gone\n",
       "near to slay her; but, by good chance, it did but shear away the visor\n",
       "of her helmet, so that her face could plainly be seen, somewhat reddened\n",
       "indeed by long toil, and with the sweat standing on it in great drops,\n",
       "but yet fair beyond all comparison. And at the same time her hair, its\n",
       "band being broken, fell down as it were a river of gold flowing about\n",
       "her. Already had the knight lifted his hand to strike again; but when he\n",
       "saw the fair face and golden hair his arm was, as it were, benumbed, his\n",
       "sword dropped from his hand, and he himself fell upon his knees.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Surely,” he said to himself, “this is some goddess that I see before\n",
       "me.” She stood, indeed, in great wrath, for she had been in sore\n",
       "straits, and anger ever follows close on fear, and made as if she would\n",
       "strike him, but he could do nothing but ask for pardon. Nor was Sir\n",
       "Scudamore less amazed, for he had by this time recovered from his swoon,\n",
       "when he saw the sight.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now Glaucé, glad at heart to see again the mistress whom she had\n",
       "missed so long, drew near, and made her a reverence, saying: “Truly I\n",
       "rejoice to see you safe after so many toils and dangers. And now, dear\n",
       "daughter, as you love me, grant these knights a truce.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“So be it,” Britomart made answer. Thereupon they lifted up their\n",
       "visors, so that their faces could be seen. And when Britomart looked on\n",
       "the face of Artegall, behold it was the very countenance of the knight\n",
       "whom she had seen long since in the magic mirror! And as she saw it her\n",
       "haughty spirit abated. She could never again lift hand against him; nay,\n",
       "when she thought to use her tongue, and reproach him with angry words,\n",
       "even her tongue failed her.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now Sir Scudamore, greatly rejoiced to know that all his fears and\n",
       "suspicions were false, drew near and said: “Surely it makes me glad, Sir\n",
       "Artegall, to see you who were wont to despise all dames, bow yourself\n",
       "before one in so lowly a fashion.” And when Britomart heard the name of\n",
       "Artegall, her heart leaped within her breast, nor for all her feigning\n",
       "could she hide the gladness which she felt. Then said Glaucé again:\n",
       "“Gentle knights, be thankful for the happy chance which has brought so\n",
       "strange an ending to your fears and troubles. Here is no thief that\n",
       "would take away from you the ladies whom you love. And you, Sir\n",
       "Artegall, who call yourself the Savage Knight, count it no shame that a\n",
       "maid has so bravely held her own against you, and strive no longer\n",
       "against love, which is the very crown of knighthood. And you, fair lady,\n",
       "turn away your wrath; if there is fire in your heart, let it be the fire\n",
       "of love.” Britomart blushed deep to hear these words, and Sir Artegall\n",
       "was glad at heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now Sir Scudamore, who was divided between hope and fear concerning\n",
       "his Amoret, spoke, saying: “Pardon me if I ask you for tidings of my\n",
       "Amoret. I know that you delivered her at no small peril from the\n",
       "Enchanter’s prison. Where is she? for I would seek her, as is, indeed,\n",
       "my bounden duty.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Britomart answered: “Sir Knight, it grieves me much that I cannot tell\n",
       "you what you seek to know. After I had delivered her from the Enchanter,\n",
       "as you know, I kept her safe. And truly there never was companion more\n",
       "dear to me than she. But one day, as we travelled, we lighted from our\n",
       "steeds by the wayside, to rest awhile. Then I laid myself down to sleep;\n",
       "but when I woke from my sleep, she was nowhere to be seen. I called her;\n",
       "I sought her far and near; but nowhere could I find her, or hear tidings\n",
       "of her.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When Sir Scudamore heard these words, he was greatly troubled, and stood\n",
       "like to a man who has received a mortal blow. But Glaucé said: “Be not\n",
       "discouraged, fair sir; hope still for the best; why should you trouble\n",
       "yourself in vain?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Little comfort did he take of these words, but when Britomart said,\n",
       "“Truly you have great cause for trouble; yet take comfort, by the light\n",
       "of day I swear that I will never leave you till I find and give her back\n",
       "to you,” then was he not a little comforted, for he had a great trust\n",
       "that what Britomart promised she would surely perform.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then they all journeyed together to a castle that was near, Sir Artegall\n",
       "being their guide. There they rested till their wounds were healed and\n",
       "their strength repaired. Meanwhile Sir Artegall paid court to Britomart,\n",
       "who, after much persuasion, though, indeed, she was not unwilling in her\n",
       "heart, consented to take him for her husband. Nevertheless their\n",
       "marriage could not be yet, because Sir Artegall was bound on a great\n",
       "adventure which he must needs carry through. Nor could she refuse to\n",
       "allow him to depart, seeing that his honour was bound in the matter.\n",
       "Only it was agreed that when three months had waxed and waned, then he\n",
       "should return. So the knight departed, Britomart going with him for a\n",
       "part of his journey. Full loath was she to leave him, finding ever new\n",
       "occasions for delay. And when these were all spent, then with a heavy\n",

       "days have I dwelt in this dreadful place; and in these twenty days have\n",

       "as fast as she could; and the monster, perceiving her flight, pursued\n",
       "her. Fleet of foot was she, but it had fared ill with her but for a\n",
       "happy chance which brought her help beyond all hope, as shall now be\n",

       "\n",
       "There dwelt in those parts a famous huntress, Belphœbe by name; this\n",
       "Belphœbe was own sister to Amoret. That day she was following the chase,\n",
       "pursuing leopards and bears, of which beasts there was a great multitude\n",
       "in those woods. With her were her companions, the forest nymphs, and\n",
       "also a gentle squire, who was her lover. Now the squire chanced to be\n",
       "separated from the rest of his company, and so came to the very place\n",
       "where the monster was in chase of Amoret. By this time he had overtaken\n",
       "her and caught her up in his arms. And when the squire perceived it, and\n",
       "set upon him, seeking to deliver her out of his hands, the villain used\n",
       "this crafty device. When the squire would have thrust at him with the\n",
       "hunting-spear which he carried, then the monster would shield himself\n",
       "with the body of Amoret. And when the squire held back his blow, or when\n",
       "the blow chanced to fall ever so lightly on the dame, then the monster\n",
       "laughed aloud. So they two contended awhile; but at the last the squire\n",
       "dealt his adversary a shrewd blow and wounded him sorely. But this did\n",
       "not abate his rage, for, throwing Amoret on the ground, he set upon the\n",
       "squire so fiercely with his club, that the man had much ado to save\n",
       "himself from being beaten down. Nor can it be known what had been the\n",
       "issue, for now Belphœbe, hearing the sound of the strokes through the\n",
       "wood, and guided by her ear, drew near, holding her bow in her hand,\n",
       "with an arrow upon the string, ready to be despatched. When the monster\n",
       "saw her, he, knowing how deadly was her aim, turned and fled. Nor did\n",
       "she fail to pursue; swift of foot was she, and ere he could reach his\n",
       "cave, she smote him on the back of the neck with an arrow. He fell to\n",
       "the ground with a great crash, and when she came up, thinking to put an\n",
       "end to him, lo! he was already dead. Thereupon she went into the cave,\n",
       "and while she wondered that a place could be so foul, she heard a\n",
       "whispering and a low sort of groaning. Then she said to herself: “Are\n",
       "these spirits that suffer in this place of dread and darkness?” and\n",
       "afterwards aloud, “If there be any here, let them come forth, if only\n",
       "they be free to move.” Thereupon Æmilia stood up from the place where\n",
       "she had been lying, and told her story. “Come forth,” said Belphœbe,\n",
       "when she heard the tale; “haply, I may give you help.” So she led her to\n",

       "there befell an evil chance which brought about no small trouble.\n",
       "\n",
       "Amoret was in a piteous plight, as may easily be believed. For first she\n",
       "had been affrighted almost to death by the monster, and then she had\n",
       "been sorely bruised when he cast her so roughly to the ground. So she\n",
       "lay as one without life, and the gentle squire was full of compassion\n",
       "when he saw her hurts, especially the wound which he himself had made\n",
       "with his hunting-spear, when the monster held her before him as a\n",
       "shield. And now Belphœbe, coming back from the cave, saw him looking at\n",
       "her, as it might be, in lover’s fashion, and a great pang of jealousy\n",
       "and anger moved in her heart. At first she thought to slay them both\n",
       "with the arrow which she held in her hand. But keeping herself back from\n",
       "this, she cried: “Is this, then, the faith you keep?” And, with the\n",
       "word, she turned her face and fled into the wood. The squire, knowing\n",
       "that he was wrongly blamed, made haste to follow her, yet, overtaking\n",
       "her, he did not dare to come near; and when he would have told her the\n",
       "truth, she would not listen, but made as if she would slay him with an\n",
       "arrow. So, after having long followed her in vain, he turned back, and\n",
       "finding a solitary place in the depth of a forest, made there a cabin\n",
       "for himself, where he dwelt in most unhappy sort. His weapons of war he\n",
       "broke, and vowed never to use them again. Also he swore a great oath\n",
       "that he would never more speak to woman; his garments, which were of the\n",
       "seemliest fashion, he cut into the strangest shape, and his hair he\n",
       "suffered to grow as it would and fall untrimmed about his shoulders. So\n",
       "he lived for many days.\n",
       "\n",
       "It chanced one day that a turtle dove which also had lost its mate came\n",
       "near, and, as if it could understand what was in his heart, behaved in a\n",
       "most friendly and familiar fashion. And this it did again and again. The\n",
       "bird would sit upon the branch of a tree hard by, and sing to him; and\n",
       "he, by way of guerdon for its song, would share with him such slender\n",
       "meals as he had. On a certain day he brought out from a certain place\n",
       "certain gifts which Belphœbe had bestowed upon him in the days when the\n",
       "affection between them was yet unbroken. Among these was a ruby of the\n",
       "finest water, with a gold setting in the shape of a heart and a chain of\n",
       "gold fastened to the setting. This jewel he took, and binding it with a\n",
       "riband of his lady’s colour, tied it round the neck of the dove, and\n",
       "solaced his mind by gazing on it. But no sooner had the bird felt the\n",
       "jewel tied about his neck than he spread out his wings and flew away.\n",
       "Not a little troubled was he at this matter, for he had lost, not the\n",
       "companionship of the bird only, but the jewel also. So was his trouble\n",
       "not a little increased. But the bird flew in a straight line to the\n",
       "abode of Belphœbe, and found her sitting in an arbour, taking rest from\n",
       "the toils of the chase. For she still followed in the ways of a\n",
       "huntress, though, in truth, she was not a little troubled that she had\n",
       "lost her lover. So soon as she saw the bird, she spied the jewel about\n",
       "his neck, and knew it for her own gift, and the riband also wherewith it\n",
       "was bound. Thereupon she rose from her place, and would have caught it\n",
       "in her hand, but the bird flew away. For a short space it flew, and then\n",
       "tarried for a space, and then when Belphœbe came near, flew away once\n",
       "more. So it drew the lady on from place to place, ever seeming ready to\n",
       "be caught, yet ever again escaping, till it brought her to the place\n",
       "where the squire dwelt in his unhappiness. There it perched on his hand,\n",
       "and sang a song, sweet and sad, as if to suit his sorrowful estate. So\n",
       "spent was he with grief and trouble that the lady knew him not, but only\n",
       "saw that he was in great misery, yet judged that he had fallen into it\n",
       "from better things. Thereupon she said: “Unhappy man, what has brought\n",
       "you into this evil plight? If it is Heaven’s will, then we must submit;\n",
       "but if it is of man’s wrongdoing, then may the wrong be set right. But\n",
       "if it is of your own will, know that no man should so neglect the gifts\n",
       "of God, who wills that all should be happy.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“O lady,” answered the squire, “surely it is no one but yourself that\n",
       "has brought me into this trouble.” And he showed her the whole truth.\n",
       "\n",
       "So peace was made again between the two.\n",

       "It is now time that the story of Sir Artegall should be told; how he was\n",
       "bred up in the ways of justice. Now this story, as it was commonly\n",
       "reported, was this: Astræa, who was the Goddess of Justice, found him\n",
       "when he was a child playing with other children of a like age; she,\n",
       "liking him well, and finding him innocent and without guile, took him\n",
       "away with her to a solitary place where she dwelt—for as yet she lived\n",
       "upon the earth—and there instructed and trained him to be such an one as\n",
       "she desired. She taught him to weigh right and wrong in equal scales,\n",
       "and to measure out equity according to the rule of conscience. And\n",
       "because there were no men in the place, she taught him to seek\n",
       "experience of the right way among the beasts of the forest; for these\n",
       "also oppress their own kind. Also she caused him to be instructed in the\n",
       "use of arms, in which use he became in due time most expert, so that he\n",
       "came to be held in high repute, as being one who could not only\n",
       "distinguish most truly between right and wrong, but could also maintain\n",
       "the same by force of arms. Also she gave him a sword of great repute\n",
       "which Jupiter himself had used in his war against the Titans; Chrysaor\n",
       "was its name, which, being interpreted, is “Sword of Gold.” Of finest\n",
       "temper was it, and beautiful to behold. Also she gave her servant to\n",
       "attend upon him—Talus was his name. This same Talus wielded an iron\n",
       "flail with which to thresh out falsehood and separate the truth.\n",
       "\n",
       "This Artegall, being now come to years of manhood, betook himself, as\n",
       "was the wont of all worthy knights in those days, to the Court of Queen\n",
       "Gloriana. And she gave him as the task which he should accomplish, the\n",
       "succouring of a distressed lady, Irene by name, from whom a tyrant, whom\n",
       "men called Grantorto, withheld the heritage which was rightly hers. For\n",
       "she judged that there was no man who could better discern the right, and\n",
       "having discerned it could more effectually cause it to prevail.\n",
       "\n",
       "So it came to pass that he and Talus, who was his squire, rode off on\n",
       "their errand. On their way they saw as sorry a sight as ever was seen by\n",
       "mortal eyes, a squire sitting upon the ground in most doleful fashion,\n",
       "and hard by him, lying on the ground, the headless corpse of a lady. It\n",
       "was indeed a piteous thing to see the gay apparel of the dead, most\n",
       "cruelly drenched in blood.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Now tell me,” cried Sir Artegall, “by what foul mischance this dreadful\n",
       "thing has happened.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Oh, sir,” answered the squire, “as I sat here with the lady whom I\n",
       "love, there came riding by a knight who had in his company this fair\n",
       "dame whom you see lying here. And whether he was taken with the sight of\n",
       "my love, or was weary of his own, I know not; but this he said: ‘Ho!\n",
       "fellow, let us make exchange.’ And when I denied his request, and the\n",
       "two ladies also cried out upon him, then he threw down the dame his\n",
       "companion on the ground, and lawlessly taking away from me my own, set\n",
       "her upon his horse. And when his lady saw what he had done, and how he\n",
       "was riding away, she followed him as fast as she could, and laying hold\n",
       "of his arm, cried out: ‘Leave me not in this fashion; slay me rather!’\n",
       "And he in a fury drew his sword, and with a single stroke shore off her\n",
       "head, even in the place where now she lies. And now he has gone, taking\n",
       "my love with him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Tell me,” said Sir Artegall, “by which way he went. Tell me also by\n",
       "what signs I may know him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“But, fair sir,” the squire made answer, “he has gone so long that you\n",
       "can scarce hope to overtake him. Yet, if you would know the way, he rode\n",
       "across the plain.” And he pointed with his hand to the course which the\n",
       "knight had followed. “As for the marks, know that he carried on his\n",
       "shield a broken sword on a field of blood; and, indeed, it seemed to be\n",
       "a fitting emblem.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Follow him,” said Sir Artegall to his page Talus. And the page followed\n",
       "him swift as a swallow flies over a field. Nor was it long before he\n",
       "overtook the knight—Sir Sanglier he was called—and bade him come back\n",
       "with him, and answer for his deed. No little scorn did the knight feel\n",
       "to be so commanded, and, setting down the lady whom he carried on his\n",
       "steed, rode at the page Talus with all his force. Full on the body he\n",
       "struck him, but moved him no more than a rock is moved by some stone\n",
       "that is thrown at it. On the other hand, Talus dealt him such a blow\n",
       "that he laid him prostrate on the ground. Ere he could recover himself,\n",
       "Talus had seized him in an iron grip, and forced him to follow him, the\n",
       "lady also, though she would have fled in her fear, following. So they\n",
       "came to Sir Artegall.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What is this that you have done?” said Sir Artegall.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay,” said the knight, “I did it not: I am guiltless of the blood of\n",
       "this dame, and this I will prove on the body of this false squire, if he\n",
       "will meet me hand to hand.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Now the squire was not of such prowess as to meet so doughty a knight.\n",
       "Then said Sir Artegall: “This is a doubtful cause, which it were not\n",
       "well to try by arbitrament of battle. Will you therefore commit the\n",
       "matter to me, and abide by my judgment and sentence?”\n",
       "\n",
       "To this they both consented. Then said Sir Artegall: “Since each of you\n",
       "denies that this lady came by her death through his deed, and each\n",
       "claims the living lady as his own, my judgment is that both the living\n",
       "and the dead shall be equally divided, and each shall have his part both\n",
       "of one and of the other. Also I decree that if either of you two shall\n",
       "reject this my sentence, he shall carry this head as a penance for\n",
       "twelve months, by way of witness that he brought about her death.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Sanglier gladly accepted the doom, but the squire was ill-content,\n",
       "for he really loved the dame who had been reft from him. “Nay,” said he,\n",
       "“I would rather by far that she should live, though I lose her.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“’Tis well said, squire!” cried Sir Artegall, “and now I perceive that\n",
       "you are indeed guiltless in this matter. As for you, Sir Knight, who\n",
       "care so little for the living or the dead, take this head and carry it\n",
       "for a twelve months’ space, to be a witness of your shame and guilt.”\n",
       "Sir Sanglier was ill content with this sentence, and would have refused\n",
       "to abide by it. Only, when he saw Talus approaching with intent to\n",
       "compel him, he made his submission, for he knew by experience how great\n",
       "was his strength.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said the squire: “Oh, sir, you have done me such service as I can\n",
       "never repay. Let me therefore attend you as your squire, and that\n",
       "without fee or favour.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Not so,” Sir Artegall made answer, “I am well content to be as I am. Do\n",
       "you follow your own affairs. As for me, Talus here will be sufficient\n",
       "for my needs.”\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "As Sir Artegall, with Talus following, rode on, he met a dwarf who was\n",
       "travelling with all the speed that he could use. “Stay awhile,” he said,\n",
       "“for I have somewhat to ask of you.” And the dwarf, though somewhat\n",
       "loath, could not but yield. Now the dwarf’s name was Dony, and he served\n",
       "the fair Florimell. Not a little of his discourse, therefore, concerned\n",
       "the said Florimell. He told how Marinell was recovered of the grievous\n",
       "wound which Britomart had given him, and how he was to wed the fair\n",
       "Florimell.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Say you so?” cried Artegall. “Tell me, therefore, when the marriage\n",
       "shall be, for I would fain be present at the celebration.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“In three days’ time, as I am informed,” answered the dwarf, “and I too\n",
       "should be there, and the place is the castle by the seashore; only there\n",
       "is a hindrance in the way, for a little farther on from this place, a\n",
       "cruel Saracen keeps the bridge by which one must needs pass. Much harm\n",
       "has he done already to travellers, and men are fain to shun the way that\n",
       "lies thereby.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Tell me more about the villain,” said Sir Artegall. Then Dony set forth\n",
       "the whole matter.\n",
       "\n",
       "“He is a man of great strength, and expert in battle. Moreover, he is\n",
       "not a little helped by the charms with which the wicked witch, his\n",
       "daughter, supports him. Thus he has gathered together much wealth, store\n",
       "of gold, and lordships and farms. This wealth he daily increases,\n",
       "greatly by means of this same bridge which he holds by force of arms. No\n",
       "one will he suffer to go over unless he first pays a toll, be he rich or\n",
       "poor. If the traveller be poor, then a squire whom he sets over this\n",
       "business extorts from him this tribute. As for the richer sort, these he\n",
       "deals with himself. Men call him Pollenté, which, being interpreted, is\n",
       "‘Powerful,’ and the name is fitting, for much power he has. And besides\n",
       "the power he has not a little cunning, for he is wont to fight on this\n",
       "same bridge. Exceeding long is it and narrow, and full of pitfalls which\n",
       "he knows, but a stranger knows not. And often it happens that the\n",
       "stranger falls through one of these said pitfalls into the river\n",
       "beneath. And while he is confused with his fall, Pollenté leaps into the\n",
       "river and takes him at a disadvantage, and either slays him outright or\n",
       "causes him to drown. Then he takes the spoils of them who perish in this\n",
       "fashion, and brings them to his daughter, who dwells hard by. Thus she\n",
       "has gathered together great store of wealth, so that she exceeds even\n",
       "kings. Her they call Munera. Very fair is she, and gorgeously attired;\n",
       "many lords have sought to have her for a wife, but in her pride she\n",
       "thinks scorn of them all.”\n",
       "\n",
       "This is the story which Dony the dwarf told to Sir Artegall. When the\n",
       "knight heard it, he cried, “Now, by my life, I will go none other way\n",
       "but this, God helping me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So he went on with Talus, and the dwarf followed. When they came to the\n",
       "bridge, there came to them an evil-looking villain, who said, “Give me\n",
       "the passage-money, according to the custom of the place!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Here,” answered Sir Artegall, “is my passage-money,” and therewith\n",
       "dealt him such a blow that he fell dead upon the ground. When the\n",
       "Saracen knight saw this, he was very wrath, and charged at Sir Artegall\n",
       "full tilt; nor did Sir Artegall lag behind. They met in the middle of\n",
       "the bridge, where there was a trap cunningly devised. The Saracen looked\n",
       "that his adversary should fall into it unawares and be sorely bruised\n",
       "and wounded; but Sir Artegall, having been forewarned by the dwarf,\n",
       "leapt into the river, clear of all that might do damage to horse or man.\n",
       "The Saracen leapt in like fashion, and the two met in the water, not one\n",
       "whit less hotly than had they been on the dry land. And here the pagan\n",
       "had no small advantage, for he was accustomed to fight in this fashion,\n",
       "and his horse also could swim like a fish. Sir Artegall, perceiving that\n",
       "the odds were against him, saw that he must close with his adversary\n",
       "without delay. Long they wrestled together, and Sir Artegall never\n",
       "loosened his grip one whit, and at last forced him from his saddle, so\n",
       "that he no longer had the advantage of the swimming of his horse. And\n",
       "yet the issue of the fight was doubtful awhile, for the Saracen was both\n",
       "brave and expert in arms. Nevertheless Sir Artegall had the better\n",
       "breath, as one that followed temperance in all things, and so prevailed\n",
       "until the Saracen was compelled to turn from the river to the land,\n",
       "hoping so to escape. Yet even as he lifted his head from the stream to\n",
       "the brink, the knight dealt him so heavy a blow that it clean shore the\n",
       "head from the neck. And this being done, then he went his way to the\n",
       "castle where the pagan’s daughter dwelt.\n",
       "\n",
       "[Illustration: Sir Artegall and the Saracen.]\n",
       "\n",
       "Here he was denied entrance, being received with so great a shower of\n",
       "stones that he was forced to retreat. Then he sent Talus, bidding him\n",
       "compel an entrance. And this he did without damage to himself, and with\n",
       "his iron flail he battered the door so fiercely that the whole place\n",
       "shook from the foundation to the roof. All who were within were greatly\n",
       "dismayed, and the Lady Munera herself came out, and stood upon the\n",
       "castle wall. When she saw in what peril she was, she used all the\n",
       "devices which she could imagine to deliver herself. First she besought\n",
       "the adversary with many prayers to cease from his attack—and, indeed,\n",
       "she was not wont to beseech in vain. Then she tried what enchantments\n",
       "could do, and of these she had a great store at her command. And when\n",
       "she found that prayers and enchantments availed nothing, she thought to\n",
       "corrupt the man with great gifts. She caused sacks of gold and precious\n",
       "things to be brought, and poured from the castle wall, thinking to\n",
       "herself that he would surely cease from his battering, and give her, at\n",
       "the least, some respite and delay.\n",
       "\n",
       "But the riches moved him no more than the entreaties and enchantments.\n",
       "Still he battered with his iron flail till he broke down the door and\n",
       "made a way for his master to enter. No one dared to lift a hand against\n",
       "them: all through the castle they moved at their will. The Lady Munera\n",
       "for a while they could not find. At the last Talus, than whom a\n",
       "bloodhound was not more keen to scent a runaway, found her hidden under\n",
       "a heap of gold. Thence he drew her from her lair, pitying her not at\n",
       "all. For now even Sir Artegall, seeing how fair she was, had some\n",
       "compassion in his heart, and when she knelt before him would have given\n",
       "her some remission of the penalty. But there was no such thought in the\n",
       "heart of Talus. He cared for naught but to do justice to the full. So he\n",
       "took her by the waist, she crying loudly the while, and cast her into\n",
       "the river. And when he had wrought this justice upon her, he took all\n",
       "the pelf that he found in the castle, and ground it small to powder, and\n",
       "threw it into the water. This done, he razed the castle to the ground,\n",
       "destroying it utterly, so that no one in days to come should think to\n",
       "set it up again. After this Sir Artegall reformed the evil customs of\n",
       "the bridge, ordering that in time to come it should be free for all to\n",
       "pass over.\n",
       "\n",
       "This good deed accomplished, they journeyed on to the castle by the sea,\n",
       "where the nuptials of Sir Marinell and the fair Florimell were to be\n",
       "celebrated with great honour. There were great feastings and rejoicings,\n",
       "to which an infinite concourse of lords and ladies resorted from all\n",
       "quarters; no knight that was held in repute for valour and deeds of arms\n",
       "was absent. When the banquet, which was furnished with all rare meats\n",
       "and drinks that the heart of man could desire, was finished, then the\n",
       "company addressed themselves to feats of arms. First came forth Sir\n",
       "Marinell and six knights with him, declaring to hold the field against\n",
       "all comers, in right of Florimell, and to affirm that she was the\n",
       "fairest of all the ladies upon earth. Against these there came from all\n",
       "parts such as desired to try their fortune in the lists—none were\n",
       "debarred. Many feats of arms were wrought that day; many knights were\n",
       "unhorsed, and some were wounded; but none, so it was judged by common\n",
       "consent, bore themselves more bravely than did Sir Marinell. His name,\n",
       "therefore, did the heralds proclaim as the champion of the day. And on\n",
       "the second day the event was the same. There was much fighting, many\n",
       "suffered loss and overthrow; and in the end the heralds proclaimed, as\n",
       "they had done before, the victory of Sir Marinell. But on the third day\n",
       "things fell out otherwise, for the knight pursuing his adversaries when\n",
       "he had put them to flight, somewhat rashly, was surrounded by them and\n",
       "taken prisoner. While they were leading him away, it so chanced that Sir\n",
       "Artegall came into the tilting-yard, and close behind him followed\n",
       "Bragadocchio, who had in his company the false Florimell.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Sir Artegall understood what mishap had befallen Sir Marinell, he\n",
       "said to Bragadocchio: “I would fain help this brave knight; but I would\n",
       "not have anyone know who I am: therefore, I pray thee, change shields\n",
       "with me.” And Bragadocchio full willingly did so, thinking that he might\n",
       "thus win to himself renown without cost or danger. Sir Artegall,\n",
       "therefore, taking Bragadocchio’s shield, set upon the knights who were\n",
       "leading away Sir Marinell. There were a hundred in all. Of these fifty\n",
       "assailed him, and the other fifty stayed behind to guard the prisoner.\n",
       "But for all that there were so many they could not stand against him.\n",
       "The fifty who assailed him he speedily put to flight, and the fifty who\n",
       "would have kept the prisoner did not hinder Sir Artegall from setting\n",
       "him free. Then Sir Marinell being delivered and armed anew, for they had\n",
       "taken his arms from him, the two joined their forces and drove their\n",
       "adversaries out of the field. There was not one among them who could\n",
       "hold up his head or make a stand against them. When Sir Artegall had\n",
       "accomplished this, then he gave back the shield to Bragadocchio, who had\n",
       "stayed to see the issue of the day, keeping with him the false\n",
       "Florimell.\n",
       "\n",
       "After this the trumpets sounded, and the judges rose up in their place\n",
       "and summoned the company, saying: “Hear! All ye knights who have borne\n",
       "arms to-day, and know to whom the prize of valour is awarded.” Then came\n",
       "forth the fair Florimell from the place where she sat, as queen of the\n",
       "tourney, that she might give to each knight his proper guerdon, and to\n",
       "him who should be held to have best acquitted himself, the first prize\n",
       "of all. Loudly did they call for the stranger knight who had wrought\n",
       "such prodigies of valour and strength in delivering Sir Marinell. He did\n",
       "not come forward, but in his stead Bragadocchio presented himself, with\n",
       "the shield bearing the device which all men knew—namely, a sun shining\n",
       "in a field of gold. When the company saw this, they, thinking that this\n",
       "was indeed the champion, set up a great shout, and the trumpets sounded,\n",
       "and Florimell rose up and greeted him most graciously, thanking him for\n",
       "his championship. But all this praise turned the vain fellow’s mind.\n",
       "“Not for your sake, madam,” said he, “but for my own dear lady’s sake\n",
       "did I this,” adding other words such as could not pass the lips of a\n",
       "true knight. Then he called to Trompart his squire, saying, “Bring forth\n",
       "the fairest of all dames!” Thereupon Trompart led forth the false\n",
       "Florimell; for he had her in keeping, hidden by a veil from the common\n",
       "sight.\n",
       "\n",
       "Great was the astonishment of the company when they saw her. “This\n",
       "surely is Florimell,” they said to themselves, “or, if it be not, then\n",
       "it is one fairer than she.” Never were men more perplexed than the\n",
       "guests that day. Nor was Sir Marinell himself less amazed than the rest,\n",
       "and, as he gazed, the more and more steadfastly did he believe that this\n",
       "false Florimell was indeed the true.\n",
       "\n",
       "But now Sir Artegall, who stood in the press of the crowd, closely\n",
       "disguised, heard the false boaster’s words, and could not contain\n",
       "himself any more, but came forth and cried with a loud voice: “False\n",
       "boaster, strutting thus in borrowed plumes, and doing dishonour to\n",
       "others with your lies, verily when each shall have his due, great will\n",
       "be your disgrace! ’Tis true that the shield which you bear was this day\n",
       "borne by him who delivered Sir Marinell, but yours was not the arm which\n",
       "struck the blow. And now hold forth your sword and let it show what\n",
       "marks of battle it bears, and if you bear in your body the mark of a\n",
       "wound, let this company behold it; nay, boaster, this is the sword which\n",
       "won the victory, and these the wounds which were endured in the\n",
       "winning!” And here he showed his sword, which bore the dint of many a\n",
       "blow, and the wounds which he carried on his arms and his body. “And,”\n",
       "he further said, “as for this Florimell of yours, I warrant she is no\n",
       "true dame, but only a fit companion for such as you.” Then he took the\n",
       "true Florimell by the hand and led her, she blushing the while, for the\n",
       "colour on her fair face was of roses mixed with lilies, and set her by\n",
       "the side of the false. And then, lo! a great marvel! The false dame\n",
       "melted away as snow melts in the sunshine! In a moment naught remained\n",
       "of her save only the empty girdle which once had compassed her waist. So\n",
       "on a day of storm we see a rainbow spanning the sky with all its goodly\n",
       "colours, and in a moment it vanishes from our sight, so did this lovely\n",
       "creature, the false Florimell, vanish from before the eyes of that\n",
       "company. And now Sir Artegall took up the golden girdle which alone\n",
       "remained of all that fair show, for this, indeed, was true, while all\n",
       "else was false. This he presented to the true Florimell, and she\n",
       "forthwith fastened it about her waist. Many a fair dame before had\n",
       "essayed to do it, but not one had found it truly and rightly fit.\n",
       "\n",
       "But the end of these things was not yet, for now Sir Guyon came forth\n",
       "from the crowd to claim his own good steed, which, as has been told, had\n",
       "been stolen from him in time past by this false thief. With one hand he\n",
       "seized the golden bit, and with the other he drew forth his sword from\n",
       "its sheath, for he would have smitten the knave with a deadly blow, but\n",
       "that the press hindered him, for now there was a great tumult in the\n",
       "place. Thereupon Sir Artegall came forth and would fain know how the\n",
       "knight had been robbed of his horse. Then Sir Guyon told the story how,\n",
       "while he was busy setting right a grievous wrong, some knave had stolen\n",
       "his horse. “And now,” said he, “I challenge the knave who robbed me of\n",
       "it to deadly combat.” So he spoke, but Bragadocchio held back. He had no\n",
       "liking for such things.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said Sir Artegall: “This is truly the law of knighthood, that if\n",
       "one man claim a thing and offer to make good his claim by might of arms,\n",
       "and the other will not, the judgment goes against the latter by default.\n",
       "Nevertheless, for further and clearer discovery of the truth, can you\n",
       "who claim this horse as your own declare some tokens in proof?”\n",
       "\n",
       "To this answered Sir Guyon: “Most truly I can. Such a token there is: a\n",
       "black spot in the beast’s mouth like in shape to a horse’s shoe.” But\n",
       "when they thought to look into his mouth so as to discern the token, he\n",
       "wounded first one and then another so sorely that they were like to die.\n",
       "From no one would he suffer such a thing. But when Sir Guyon called him\n",
       "by his name—Brigador—he, hearing the voice, stood still, as if he had\n",
       "been bound, and suffered them to open his mouth, so that all could see\n",
       "the mark as it had been described. Nay more, he would follow Sir Guyon,\n",
       "breaking the band with which he was tied, and frisked right gaily, ay,\n",
       "and bent his knee.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said Sir Artegall: “Now it may be plainly discerned that the horse\n",
       "is indeed yours. Take it therefore, with its saddle of gold, and let\n",
       "this boaster go horseless, till he can win a steed for himself.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Much was Bragadocchio moved to be so shamed in the presence of all that\n",
       "company—so moved that for a while he laid aside his very cowardice, and\n",
       "broke forth into angry words against Sir Artegall. The knight made as if\n",
       "he would have slain the knave with his sword, but Sir Guyon stayed him.\n",
       "“Sir,” said he, “it would ill suit your dignity to vent your wrath on\n",
       "such a knave as this. The meetest punishment for him is to be put to\n",
       "open shame in the sight of all this company.”\n",
       "\n",
       "But Talus was not minded to let the knave escape so easily. He caught\n",
       "him by the neck and led him out of the hall, and shaved his beard, and\n",
       "reft away his shield, and blotted out the escutcheon, and defaced all\n",
       "his arms. Nor did the false squire, Trompart, fare better, though he\n",
       "cunningly had essayed to fly, for Talus overtook him and served him in\n",

       "battered, whether by the violence of the sea or by the chances of long\n",
       "travel from foreign parts. It was indeed for this that the two seemed to\n",
       "be contending, for now the one and now the other would lay his hands\n",
       "upon it; so did they well-nigh come to blows, but the two damsels had so\n",
       "far hindered them from coming to this extremity. Not the less were they\n",
       "bent on trying their cause by the sword. It seemed as if it could not be\n",
       "decided in any other fashion. But when they were on the point to do so,\n",
       "notwithstanding all that the damsels could say or do, then did Sir\n",

       "“Sirs,” said he, “are you content to tell me the cause of your strife?”\n",
       "To this the two gave a common consent.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Sir,” said the elder—Bracidas was his name—“our father, who was a\n",
       "knight, Milesio by name, divided between us, by his testament, his\n",
       "estate, that is to say, two islands which you see yonder. One is but a\n",
       "little mount, but in years past it was fully as long and broad as that\n",
       "which you see on the other side of the bay. To me he bequeathed that\n",
       "island which you see to be so small; for the sea, as years have passed\n",
       "by, has wasted it, and in so doing has largely increased the other, for\n",
       "what the waves took away from my land they added unto his. There is also\n",
       "this to be told. I was betrothed to that fair lady who stands yonder,\n",
       "Philtera by name, and with her I was to receive a goodly dowry, so soon\n",
       "as we should be linked together in bonds of wedlock. My younger brother,\n",
       "whose name is Amidas, was betrothed to that other dame whom you see\n",
       "yonder, Lucy by name. She had but small dower, but much of that which is\n",
       "far better—to wit, goodness. Now when the lady Philtera saw that my\n",
       "lands had been greatly decayed and the lands of my brother not less\n",
       "increased, she deserted me and betook herself to my brother, who, that\n",
       "he might receive her, deserted his own betrothed, to wit, the fair Lucy.\n",
       "Thereupon this damsel, in her unhappiness, thinking it better to die\n",
       "than to suffer such a contumely and pain, threw herself into the sea.\n",
       "But while she floated among the waves, being, I take it, buoyed up by\n",
       "her clothing, she chanced upon this chest which you see. And now there\n",
       "befell her what has often befallen others in like case. She, who had\n",
       "thought death to be better than life, when she saw his terrors close at\n",
       "hand, changed her mind, and desired to live. Catching hold, therefore,\n",
       "of this chest, she clung to it, and after much tossing by the sea, was\n",
       "at last thrown upon my island, and I, chancing at that time to be\n",
       "walking on the shore, espied her; and she being by this time much spent\n",
       "with hunger and cold, and little able to help herself, I did, so to\n",

       "this same help, bestowed upon me the dowry which fortune had given her,\n",
       "to wit the chest on which she had chanced, and what was far more\n",
       "precious, her own self. When we had opened the chest, we found in it a\n",
       "great store of treasure, and took it for our own use. But now this\n",
       "damsel, Philtera, maintains that this chest is hers by right, that she\n",
       "was bringing it from foreign lands that she might deliver it to her\n",
       "husband, and that she suffered shipwreck by the way. Whether this be so\n",
       "or no, I cannot say; but this I do maintain, that whatever by good\n",
       "fortune or by the ordering of God has been brought into my hands is\n",
       "verily mine, I not having in any wise contrived the same. My land he\n",

       "turning himself to the elder, he said: “Bracidas, by what right do you\n",

       "without reason, that it is theirs?”\n",

       "it. He may bestow it as he will. The land which he took from Sir\n",

       "crowd of women, in warlike array, with weapons in their hands. And in\n",
       "the midst of them he saw a knight, with his hands tied tightly behind\n",
       "his back, and a halter about his neck; his face was covered, but his\n",
       "head was bare. It was plain that the man was about to be hanged. And, as\n",

       "defy all the knights of Queen Gloriana. Some she had put to shame, and\n",
       "some she had slain. And the cause of her rage was this. She had loved\n",
       "the bold Bellodant, and when he disdained her, then her love was turned\n",
       "to hatred, not towards him only, but towards all knights, to whom she\n",
       "worked, as, indeed, she still works, all the mischief that she can\n",
       "devise. Any whom she can subdue, either by force or fraud, she treats in\n",
       "the most evil fashion. First she takes from them their arms and armour,\n",
       "and then she clothes them in women’s garments, and compels them to earn\n",
       "their bread by women’s work, spinning and sewing and washing and the\n",
       "like. And all the food that she gives them in recompense is but bread\n",
       "and water, so as to disable them from taking their revenge. And if\n",
       "anyone is of so manly a mind that he sets himself against her pleasure,\n",
       "him she causes to be hanged out of hand on that gibbet which you see\n",
       "yonder. And in this case I stood. For when she overcame me in fight,\n",

       "look!” Thereupon all the people ran in haste to arm themselves, like to\n",
       "bees when they come forth in a swarm from their hive, and Radigund\n",
       "herself, half-arrayed as a man, came forth from her palace. Meanwhile\n",
       "the three drew near to the city gate, and when the porter, thinking\n",
       "scorn of them because they were so few, did not trouble to open to them\n",
       "the gate, they beat upon it with many blows, threatening the man also\n",
       "that he should suffer much for his insolence.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the queen heard this she fell into a great rage and cried: “Open\n",
       "the gate; these fellows shall soon know to what a city they have come!”\n",
       "So the porter threw wide the gate, and the three pressed forward,\n",
       "meaning to pass through. But lo! of a sudden there fell upon them such a\n",
       "storm of arrows that they had perforce to halt.\n",
       "\n",
       "“These women,” said Sir Artegall, “are stout fighters; let us be careful\n",
       "what we do.” And when they halted, the rout set upon them more fiercely\n",
       "than ever. As for Queen Radigund, when she saw Sir Turpine, and knew\n",
       "that he had escaped from the doom which she had decreed for him, and was\n",
       "now dealing blows to her women, she was carried away with rage, and flew\n",
       "at him headlong, as a lioness flings herself at an ox, and dealt him so\n",
       "fierce a blow as brought him headlong to the ground. And when she saw\n",
       "him lying she set her foot upon his neck, with intent to make him pay\n",
       "with his life for his disparagement of her authority. So does a bear\n",
       "stand over the carcase of an ox, and seem to pause awhile to hear its\n",
       "piteous crying. When Sir Artegall saw what had befallen Sir Turpine, he\n",
       "made all haste to help him, and dealt the queen so mighty a blow that it\n",
       "reft her of her senses; nay, but that she somewhat broke its force, for\n",
       "she was expert in arms, it had laid her dead upon the ground. For a\n",
       "while she lay without speech or hearing; then, recovering herself, she\n",
       "would have assailed him with all her might, for never before had she\n",
       "endured such disgrace. But when her maidens saw it, for a great company,\n",
       "armed for battle, accompanied her, they thrust themselves between; for\n",
       "they deemed that she was not wholly in fit condition for fighting. Thus\n",
       "were Sir Artegall and Queen Radigund perforce kept apart. As for the\n",
       "rest, Talus, with his iron flail, drove them hither and thither,\n",
       "breaking their bows and marring their shooting, and they fled before him\n",
       "as sheep fly from a wolf.\n",
       "\n",
       "When evening came, Queen Radigund bade the trumpeters sound a recall, so\n",
       "that the soldiers should cease fighting. All the people she made pass\n",
       "back into the city; and she caused all them that were wounded to be\n",
       "carried to houses where their hurts might be healed. Then Sir Artegall\n",
       "caused his tent to be pitched, on the open plain, not far from the gate\n",
       "of the city. There he and Sir Turpine took their ease, but Talus, as was\n",
       "his custom, kept watch all the night. But Radigund was ill-content with\n",
       "what had happened that day; never before had her pride been so rebuked.\n",
       "She could not rest, but cast about in her mind how she could avenge\n",
       "herself for the shame which had been put upon her that day, and that for\n",
       "the first time in her life. After a while she made this resolve in her\n",
       "mind; that she would meet the knight in single combat and make trial of\n",
       "his strength, for that her people should suffer such waste and ruin as\n",
       "she had seen that day was a thing not to be endured. Then she asked for\n",
       "one of her maidens, Clarin by name, whom she judged to be most\n",
       "trustworthy, and fit to do her errand, and said to her: “Clarin, go\n",
       "quickly, and bear a message to the stranger knight, who has so\n",
       "distressed us this day, saying that I will meet him to-morrow in single\n",
       "combat, that we may see whether he or I be the better. Say also that\n",
       "these are my conditions: If I overcome him, then he shall render me\n",
       "obedience and be bound for ever to my service; and I, if he should\n",
       "vanquish me, do promise to do the same. Go, therefore, taking with you\n",
       "six of your fellows, arrayed as finely as may be, that they may be\n",
       "witnesses of this covenant! Take with you also wine and meats, that he\n",
       "may eat. Verily, if I have my will, he shall sit hungry many a day!”\n",
       "\n",
       "So the damsel did as she was bidden, taking with her six companions, and\n",
       "meat and drink also. When she came to the gate of the city she bade the\n",
       "trumpeter blow a blast for warning to the knights. And when Talus came\n",
       "forth, she said that she would fain speak with his master. So being\n",
       "brought with her companions into the tent, she delivered to him the\n",
       "message of the queen. Sir Artegall received her right courteously, and\n",
       "when she had departed—not without gifts—he betook himself to sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "The next day the two adversaries made themselves ready for battle. Sir\n",
       "Artegall was accoutred as knights commonly are; not so Queen Radigund.\n",
       "She wore a purple cloak, embroidered with silver, with ribands of\n",
       "diverse colours, nicely ordered upon it. This cloak, for easier motion,\n",
       "she shortened to her thighs; but when she pleased, she could let it fall\n",
       "to her heels. She had for defence of her body a cuirass of chain-mail;\n",
       "buskins she had, finely embroidered with bars of gold; at her side she\n",
       "had a scimitar hanging to a most gorgeous belt; her shield was finely\n",
       "decked with precious stones, it was like the moon when it is at the\n",
       "full. In this guise she came out of the city gate, a noble sight to see;\n",
       "about her was a bodyguard of maidens, some of whom made music with\n",
       "shawms and trumpets. Her people had pitched a pavilion for her, where\n",
       "she might rest till the fight should begin. After this Sir Artegall came\n",
       "out of his tent, fully armed, and first entered the lists. Nor did\n",
       "Radigund long delay to follow him. And when the lists had been barred\n",
       "against the crowd, for a great multitude of people were gathered to see\n",
       "the issue of the battle, the trumpets sounded the signal, and the combat\n",
       "began.\n",
       "\n",
       "The queen charged first in the most furious fashion, as if she would\n",
       "have done her adversary to death out of hand. But he, having had much\n",
       "experience in such matters, was not carried out of himself by her rage,\n",
       "but was content to defend himself from her assault; the greater was her\n",
       "fury, the more calmly did he bear himself. But when her strength began\n",
       "to fail her, then he took the other part; even as a smith, when he finds\n",
       "the metal grow soft, plies his hammer with all his might. Even so did\n",
       "Sir Artegall deal blow upon blow as if she were an anvil; and the sparks\n",
       "flew from her armour, and from her shield also, for with this she\n",
       "guarded herself in right skilful fashion from his assault. But now\n",
       "things began to go ill with her; for off this same shield the knight\n",
       "with one stroke shore away a full half, so that her side for half its\n",
       "length was exposed. Yet not one whit was she dismayed, but, smiting him\n",
       "with her scimitar, wounded him on the thigh, making the blood flow\n",
       "amain. Loud did she boast when she saw the blood, thinking that she had\n",
       "wounded him to death; but he, provoked by her boasting, struck at her\n",
       "with all his might, and when she put her shield to ward the blow, lo!\n",
       "this was shattered altogether, and fell in pieces on the plain. Next, as\n",
       "she was thus left without defence, he smote her again, this time upon\n",
       "the helmet; so that she fell from her horse, and lay upon the plain,\n",
       "like to one that was dead. When he saw her lying thus, he leapt from his\n",
       "steed and unlaced her helmet, with intent to sever her head from her\n",
       "body. But when he had unlaced her helmet, lo! her face was discovered to\n",
       "him. So fair it was, even though covered with blood and sweat, that he\n",
       "stood amazed; it was as when a traveller sees the face of the moon\n",
       "through a foggy night. And at the sight, all the cruel purpose departed\n",
       "out of his heart. So great was his pity that he threw his sword from\n",
       "him, for, indeed, there is no heart so hard but that the sight of beauty\n",
       "will soften it.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he stood thus astonished, she recovered herself from her swoon, and\n",
       "saw the knight standing by her side without a weapon. Then she lifted\n",
       "herself from the ground and flew upon him with all her former rage. He,\n",
       "indeed, could but ward off her blows with his shield, as well as he\n",
       "could. And now, being without hope, he entreated her to withhold her\n",
       "hand. “Not so,” said she, “till you have yielded to me your shield in\n",
       "token of submission.” Nor could he refuse so to do. He had overcome her\n",
       "in fair fight, yet now was he himself overcome by his own misdoing, for\n",
       "he had of his own accord given up his sword, and so lost that which he\n",
       "had attained. Then she struck him on the shoulder with the flat of her\n",
       "sword, in token that he was from henceforth her subject. As for the\n",
       "unhappy Sir Turpine, he was indeed born under an unlucky star, for they\n",
       "took him back to the place from which he had escaped, and there hanged\n",
       "him shamefully by the heels. Talus they could not take, for all that\n",
       "they sought to lay hands upon him. He laid about him so unmercifully\n",
       "with his flail, that they were right glad to let him escape. Many did he\n",
       "wound and some he slew; the rest he put into great fear. Yet he would\n",
       "not seek to rescue his lord. “Nay,” said he to himself, “Sir Artegall\n",
       "has yielded himself of his own accord, and I must e’en let him be.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Queen Radigund took the knight who had thus made himself her subject,\n",
       "and despoiled him of all his arms and armour, and put upon him woman’s\n",
       "clothing, with a white apron in place of a breast-plate. Having thus\n",
       "arrayed him, she brought him into a great chamber, on the walls of which\n",
       "were many memorials of other knights whom she had dealt with in the same\n",
       "fashion. His arms and armour she caused to be hung up among these, and\n",
       "his sword, lest it should work mischief to her, she broke in twain. When\n",
       "he was come into this place, he saw sitting there many brave knights\n",
       "whose names he knew right well, bound all of them to obey the amazon’s\n",
       "law, and spinning and carding wool. This they did under constraint, for\n",
       "they were bound to finish their task by the appointed time, nothing\n",
       "being given them whereon to dine or sup but what they could earn by this\n",
       "woman’s work. The queen set him in the lowest place of all, and put a\n",
       "distaff into his hands, and bade him spin flax and tow. Truly it is the\n",
       "hardest of all lots to be a woman’s slave! But he consented to her will,\n",
       "saying to himself: “She vanquished me in battle, and I must abide by my\n",
       "own word.”\n",
       "\n",
       "After a while the queen began to feel the beginning of love for the\n",
       "knight. Long time she strove against it, thinking shame to be so\n",
       "overcome; but finding that her passion was not to be put away, she sent\n",
       "for the same Clarin, whom she had before made her messenger, and said to\n",
       "her: “Clarin, you see that fairy knight, who has been made my subject,\n",
       "not by my valour, but by his own honourable mind. He gave me my life,\n",
       "when it was lost; why should he suffer there in this cruel bondage? Why\n",
       "should I recompense him with ill for so good a deed? I would fain give\n",
       "him his freedom, yet in such a fashion that in giving it to him, I may\n",
       "win his free goodwill. I would loose him, and yet have him still bound\n",
       "to me, not with the bonds of violence and compulsion, but of benevolence\n",
       "and love. Now if you can by any means win him to such a mood, but\n",
       "without discovering, mark you well, my thought, you will win a goodly\n",
       "reward from him, and have me also greatly beholden to you. And now, that\n",
       "you may be able to pass freely to and fro, I give you this ring as a\n",
       "token to Eumenias”—this was the keeper of the knights’ prison. “Go then,\n",
       "my Clarin; use to the best all thy wits, employing both enticing looks\n",
       "and fair speeches.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So Clarin, promising that she would use her best endeavour to win Sir\n",
       "Artegall to such thoughts as her lady desired, departed on her errand.\n",
       "She had recourse to all the arts she knew to win his favourable regard,\n",
       "and one day she said to him: “Sir Knight, you have had but an evil\n",
       "fortune; you sit drowned in despair, and yet you might raise yourself,\n",
       "if you were but willing, to something better.”\n",
       "\n",
       "He was in doubt what this speech might mean, and so made answer: “Fair\n",
       "damsel, that you regard me with compassion is in itself a kindness for\n",
       "which I am in your debt. But you must know that a brave heart bears with\n",
       "equal courage fair weather and foul, frowns of ill fortune or smiles of\n",
       "prosperity. At this moment my life is overcast with cloud, yet I hope\n",
       "for sunshine to come.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yea,” answered the maiden, “and what say you if you should see an\n",
       "occasion ready to your hand for entering on better things?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Truly,” answered Sir Artegall, “I count him to be unworthy of good\n",
       "fortune who should not promptly take such occasion, so that it come\n",
       "within his reach.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said Clarin: “Why do you not set about to win your liberty by\n",
       "seeking the favour of the queen? ’Tis true that she has passed her days\n",
       "in war, yet she is not born of tigers or bears. She scorns the love of\n",
       "men, yet she does not forget that she is herself of the kindred of man.”\n",
       "\n",
       "To this Sir Artegall replied: “Believe me, fair damsel, that not from\n",
       "obstinacy or disdain have I neglected to seek her favour. ’Tis lack of\n",
       "means that has kept me back from so doing; and if you can in any way\n",
       "supply this lack, then shall I be bound to you for ever.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“This fish bites at the bait,” said the damsel to herself, “but it is\n",
       "not yet surely caught.” But even while she spoke, she herself, foolish\n",
       "maiden that she was, was caught herself. For, as a fisher who, while he\n",
       "seeks for the prey, falls into the brook, so Clarin, seeking to serve\n",
       "her mistress’s ends, conceived a great pity for this captive knight, and\n",
       "from pity it is but a short journey to love. But her love she durst not\n",
       "tell, neither to the knight, lest haply she should be disdained, nor to\n",
       "anyone else, lest that by any means it should come to the knowledge of\n",
       "the queen, for that she knew would mean a sure sentence of death.\n",
       "Therefore she kept the matter in her heart, watching for such occasion\n",
       "as might arise.\n",
       "\n",
       "Queen Radigund, growing impatient of the delay, bade her unfold the\n",
       "truth. “How have you fared?” she said, “What is the temper of the man?\n",
       "Has captivity brought him to a more humble mind?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Not so,” said Clarin; “he is as stern and obstinate as ever. He scorns\n",
       "all offers and conditions; he would sooner die—so he declares—than look\n",
       "with any favour on those who have done him so great a wrong. This in\n",
       "brief is his resolve; in truth these are his very words: ‘My body may be\n",
       "thrall to the queen, but my heart is free.’”\n",
       "\n",
       "When she heard these words the queen fell into a mighty rage. But coming\n",
       "to herself, and perceiving that anger would profit her nothing, she said\n",
       "to her minister: “Clarin, what remains for us to do? It were a shame to\n",
       "have laboured in vain, and still more a shame to sit down content when\n",
       "this fellow flouts us in such fashion. Nevertheless, that his guilt may\n",
       "be seen to be the greater, and my grace the more admirable, I will bear\n",
       "with this folly of his till you shall have made another trial of him.\n",
       "And you I charge to leave nothing that can be done or said to work upon\n",
       "him. Leave nothing unpromised that may help to persuade him. Tell him\n",
       "that he shall have life, freedom, grace, and store of gifts, for by\n",
       "gifts even the hearts of gods are touched. And to these promises add all\n",
       "your arts and woman’s wiles. And if your arts avail nothing, then let\n",
       "him feel the weight of your hand. Diminish his victuals; maybe he is too\n",
       "proudly fed; put more labour upon him, and with harder conditions; let\n",
       "him lodge less softly, lying upon straw; do aught that may abate his\n",
       "courage and his pride; put a chain of cold iron upon him, and deny him\n",
       "all that he may desire. And when you have done all this, tell me how he\n",
       "bears himself. If need be, I will deal with him, not as a lover, but as\n",
       "a rebel.”\n",
       "\n",
       "All this Clarin heard, and made pretence to fulfil her lady’s commands.\n",
       "But her mind was turned to quite another thing, that is to say, to play\n",
       "her mistress false, and to gain the knight’s love for herself. To him\n",
       "therefore she made as great a show of goodwill as she could, telling him\n",
       "that she was making suit for him to the queen, that she should set him\n",
       "at liberty, but that she could not persuade her.\n",
       "\n",
       "“The more I entreat her,” she said, “the sterner and the harsher she\n",
       "is.” Then from the knight she would go to the queen and say: “The more\n",
       "grace I show, the more haughty and unbending is he.” As for Sir\n",
       "Artegall, he spoke the woman fair, but never did he depart from his\n",
       "loyalty to his own fair lady.\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "While Sir Artegall lay thus in evil plight under the tyranny of Queen\n",
       "Radigund, the Lady Britomart was in no small distress of mind. For now\n",
       "the latest date that had been fixed for his return was long past, and\n",
       "yet no tidings of him had come. Sometimes she thought that some mishap\n",
       "had befallen him in his adventure, and sometimes that his false foe had\n",
       "entrapped him, and sometimes—and this was the most grievous fear of\n",
       "all—that he had bestowed his love upon another. She knew no ill of him,\n",
       "nor ever had heard any; yet could she not forbear to think ill. Now she\n",
       "blamed herself, and now she condemned him as being faithless and untrue.\n",
       "Then again she would think to herself: “Surely I have miscounted the\n",
       "time,” and she reckoned the days and weeks and months again; and,\n",
       "indeed, the days were as weeks and the weeks were as months. Also she\n",
       "considered within herself what she should do; should she send someone to\n",
       "search for him, and yet who could go on such an errand but herself? She\n",
       "could not rest in her dwelling, no place could please her; yet that\n",
       "which displeased her least was a certain window which looked towards the\n",
       "west, for it was from the west that Sir Artegall was due to come. It\n",
       "chanced then that as she sat at this same window on a certain day she\n",
       "saw someone approaching at full speed. No sooner did she see him, though\n",
       "she could not discern his face, than she said to herself, “This is\n",
       "someone from my love.” And truly, when he came nearer, she perceived\n",
       "that it was Sir Artegall’s groom Talus. The sight filled her heart both\n",
       "with hopes and with fears; nor could she stay in her place, but ran\n",
       "forth to meet him, crying, “Where is your lord? Is he far from here? Has\n",
       "he lost or has he won?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Talus, albeit he was made of iron, and was without feeling of pain and\n",
       "sorrow, yet was conscious within himself that his news was ill, and\n",
       "stood silent as if he would rather that she should discern his tidings\n",
       "than that he should declare them. Then she said: “Take courage, Talus;\n",
       "tell me what you have to tell, be it good or be it bad.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then he answered: “If I must tell my evil tidings, so be it. My lord\n",
       "lies in wretched bondage.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“How came that to pass?” said Britomart; “did the tyrant, his enemy,\n",
       "vanquish him?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Not so,” quoth Talus, “no tyrant man did vanquish him, but a tyrant\n",
       "woman.” Great was the rage of Britomart when she heard these words.\n",
       "\n",
       "“And you are not ashamed, evil newsmonger, to come here with such\n",
       "tidings of your lord’s disgrace?” And she turned her back upon him,\n",
       "seeking her own chamber; and there with much self-torturing she spent\n",
       "many weary hours.\n",
       "\n",
       "The next day she sought out Talus again, and being now in a milder mood,\n",
       "she said: “Tell me now plainly how came Sir Artegall into this\n",
       "captivity. Does he woo this tyrant lady?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ah! madam!” answered Talus, “he is in no state to woo; he lies in\n",
       "thraldom, weak and wan; and yet, for the truth must be told, it was by\n",
       "his own doing that he came into this state.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Britomart’s anger was kindled again. “Are you not leagued together\n",
       "to deceive me? You say that he came into this bondage of his own accord;\n",
       "is he not then false?”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Talus unfolded the whole story of how Sir Artegall fought, and how\n",
       "he was vanquished, not by the strength of his adversary, but by his own\n",
       "compassion. When Britomart heard this same story, she was, so to speak,\n",
       "torn asunder by anger and grief, nor would anything content her but that\n",
       "she must straightway put on her armour, mount her horse, and ride forth\n",
       "to deliver Sir Artegall, Talus being her guide. After they had ridden\n",
       "for a space they came upon a knight who was riding slowly across the\n",
       "plain, a man well stricken in years, and of a very modest and peaceable\n",
       "bearing. He saluted Britomart right courteously, and she, though in her\n",
       "sad mood she would sooner have remained without speech, answered him\n",
       "pleasantly. Then he began to talk of many things, and she, though wholly\n",
       "occupied in her mind with one matter, to wit, the deliverance of Sir\n",
       "Artegall from his prison, made such replies as were suitable. After some\n",
       "converse he said: “Friend, night is about to fall, and there are tokens\n",
       "of rain in the heavens; will you not lodge with me at my house?” And\n",
       "Britomart, seeing that the day was far spent, consented.\n",
       "\n",
       "They rode therefore to the knight’s dwelling, which was, indeed, hard\n",
       "by. There he most hospitably entertained them, both with good cheer and\n",
       "pleasant conversation. When the hour of rest came, Britomart was\n",
       "conducted to the bower where she should sleep. There she found grooms\n",
       "who offered to undress her, but she would not doff her arms for all her\n",
       "host’s entreaties. “Nay,” she said, “I have vowed a vow that I will not\n",
       "take off these arms till I have taken vengeance for a great wrong that\n",
       "has been done to me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When she made this answer, it might have been perceived that her host\n",
       "was somewhat troubled. Nevertheless he took his leave right courteously,\n",
       "and departed. Britomart watched all the night; if sleep seemed about to\n",
       "settle for a moment on her eyes, she shook it off with a right resolute\n",
       "will. And Talus watched also; outside her door did he lie in no small\n",
       "trouble of mind, as a dog that keeps guard over his master’s chamber. So\n",
       "night passed, but about the dawn, when the cock commonly crows for the\n",
       "first time, Britomart perceived that the bed in her chamber began to\n",
       "sink through the floor, and that after awhile it was raised again. And\n",
       "while she waited to see what this might mean, though indeed it was clear\n",
       "that it meant treachery of some sort, there came two knights to her\n",
       "chamber door, with a rabble rout of followers after them. But these came\n",
       "on a vain errand. Talus, having his iron flail ready to his hand, laid\n",
       "about him with a right goodwill. They fled before him, both knights and\n",
       "the rabble also. Some he struck to the ground as they fled, and others\n",
       "as they strove to hide themselves in dark corners of the house.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now the true story of the matter is this. This knight, who seemed so\n",
       "gentle and courteous, was one Dolon, a man of great cunning and of an\n",
       "evil mind. He had been a knight in his youth, yet had achieved no\n",
       "honour; only by his craft he had undone many men who were better than\n",
       "himself. Three sons he had, of the same temper as himself, full of fraud\n",
       "and guile. One of these, the eldest in birth, Guizor by name, had been\n",
       "slain by Sir Artegall in battle, not without his deserving, for he had\n",
       "sought to compass some treachery. And now this Dolon would have taken\n",
       "vengeance for this injury. Britomart he took for Sir Artegall, chiefly\n",
       "by reason of the page Talus, with the iron flail, whom he had seen in\n",
       "his company. The next day, so soon as it was light, Britomart departed.\n",
       "And when the two knights would have stayed her going, and this on the\n",
       "bridge where Artegall had fought Pollenté, she vanquished them. And one\n",
       "she caught up in her arms, and carrying him to the bridge end, cast him\n",
       "into the water, where he perished miserably.\n",
       "\n",
       "After journeying awhile, Britomart, with Talus her guide, came to the\n",
       "city of Queen Radigund. The queen, when she was advised of her coming,\n",
       "was greatly rejoiced, for she had not had the great joy of battle for\n",
       "many days, and it always pleased her greatly to have experience of a new\n",
       "adversary. She commanded that a pavilion should be set up outside the\n",
       "city gate for the new-comer. There Britomart rested that night, Talus\n",
       "keeping watch, as was his wont, at the door. The townsfolk also kept\n",
       "watch upon the walls. At sunrise the queen caused a trumpet to be blown\n",
       "to warn the stranger that the hour of battle was come. Such warning\n",
       "Britomart needed not, for she had slept but ill, so troubled was she in\n",
       "heart with jealousy and anger. Then the two made ready for the combat.\n",
       "But first the queen would have her adversary bind herself to perpetual\n",
       "service if the fortune of the day should go against her.\n",
       "\n",
       "But Britomart cried: “I will have no such conditions, no terms will I\n",
       "accept but such as are prescribed by the laws of chivalry!” Then the\n",
       "trumpets sounded again, and the two ran at each other with great fury.\n",
       "It seemed to them who looked on that both the one and the other had\n",
       "forgotten all their skill in arms, so possessed were they with rage.\n",
       "They sought not to ward off blows, but only to strike. And, indeed, none\n",
       "could have said who struck the harder.\n",
       "\n",
       "At last Radigund, thinking that she had her adversary at a disadvantage,\n",
       "dealt her a blow with all her might, saying at the same time: “You love\n",
       "this man; here then is a token of your love, which you may show him; for\n",
       "what could be a surer proof than to die for him?”\n",
       "\n",
       "But Britomart answered: “Have done with idle words about my love,” and\n",
       "though she was sorely wounded by the stroke, for the blade, breaking\n",
       "through the shoulder-plate of her armour, bit to the bone, she gave in\n",
       "return even more than she had received. The sharpness of the pain gave a\n",
       "new force to her arm, and she struck the queen so fierce a blow on the\n",
       "head that it broke through her helmet and laid her senseless on the\n",
       "ground. Nor did Britomart wait for her adversary to recover herself;\n",
       "but, urged by injured love and pride, and the fresh smarting of her\n",
       "wound, with one blow cleft both helmet and head. When her guards\n",
       "perceived this dreadful sight, they fled headlong to the city, but did\n",
       "not so escape, for Talus, taking up his flail, entered at the gate along\n",
       "with the rout of fugitives, and dealt death in every direction. Small\n",
       "need had they, I ween, of a physician on whom one of his strokes had\n",
       "lighted. Verily he had destroyed them all, but that the heart of\n",
       "Britomart was moved to see such great slaughter.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hold your hand,” she cried; “it is enough!” Then she commanded that\n",
       "someone should lead her to the prison where Sir Artegall was kept in\n",
       "bonds. Much was she moved to see these knights in their womanish attire,\n",
       "plying distaff and spindle. But when she espied Sir Artegall himself,\n",
       "and saw how pale and wan and wasted he was, her heart was well-nigh\n",
       "broken in her breast. Bitterly did she repent of her unkind suspicions:\n",
       "this was no lover of women whom she saw before her in so sad a plight!\n",
       "\n",
       "Then she bade take him to a chamber where he might put off these\n",
       "uncomely garments, and put on the apparel that belonged to a knight, and\n",
       "take again his arms and armour, of which there was a great store in the\n",
       "place. Not a little rejoiced was she when she saw how he became again\n",
       "like to the knight whom she had seen long since in the magic mirror.\n",
       "\n",
       "For a while they tarried in the city, for he needed to rest, and she had\n",
       "wounds which it was well to heal. And she, being now queen of the land\n",
       "in the place of the dead Radigund, wholly changed the form of the\n",
       "commonwealth. She did away with this same monstrous rule of women, and\n",
       "ordered all things according to the ordering of nature, and showed such\n",
       "justice and wisdom that the people gladly made submission to her\n",
       "government. The knights whom she found in the prison-house she set free,\n",
       "and made them rulers in the city, having first caused them to take an\n",
       "oath to be loyal to Sir Artegall. There was but one thing that troubled\n",
       "her: to wit, that her lover must now proceed on the errand to which he\n",
       "was bound.\n",
       "\n",
       "This he did in not many days’ time, Talus travelling with him as before.\n",
       "After a while they saw a damsel on a palfrey, flying as fast as she\n",
       "could, and two knights pursuing her also at their utmost speed; they saw\n",
       "also how another knight was riding after these two. Each was intent on\n",
       "his own business, the two knights on chasing the damsel, the single\n",
       "knight on chasing the two, the damsel seeking if, by any means, she\n",
       "could escape. But when she saw Sir Artegall, being at her wits’ end, she\n",
       "turned her course towards him, hoping that he might give her help. The\n",
       "foremost of her pursuers—pagan knights both of them—continued his\n",
       "course, and with his spear in rest charged Sir Artegall. But there he\n",
       "had met more than his match; the Christian was both stronger and more\n",
       "skilful in arms, and drove him out of the saddle full two spears’\n",
       "length, and it so chanced that in falling he lighted on his head, and so\n",
       "was killed outright.\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile his companion had fared as ill, for the single knight\n",
       "overtaking him, had compelled him to stand and do battle, in which\n",
       "battle he was defeated and slain. This done, he still followed, and\n",
       "taking Sir Artegall for the other pagan, charged him at full tilt. They\n",
       "met with a great crash, and both their spears were broken, and though\n",
       "neither was driven from his saddle, yet they tottered as two towers\n",
       "which an earthquake makes to rock. But when they drew their swords to\n",
       "renew the combat, the damsel, seeing that her two friends were like to\n",
       "come to as ill an end as had her two foes, ran up, crying out: “Oh,\n",
       "sirs, stay your hands till I shall tell you how the matter stands. ’Tis\n",
       "I that have been wronged, and you have brought me help, slaying these\n",
       "two pagans who were pursuing me. These lie dead upon the ground; what\n",
       "quarrel have you against each other? If there be still any wrongdoer or\n",
       "cause of trouble, truly it is I.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When the two heard these words, they held their hands, and, lifting up\n",
       "the visors of their helmets, looked each in the other’s face. And when\n",
       "Sir Artegall saw the last comer, who was no other than Prince Arthur, he\n",
       "was sure that he was a very noble knight, and said: “Pardon me, fair\n",
       "sir, that I have erred in lifting my hand against you. I will make what\n",
       "amends you will.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Talk not of amends,” answered the prince; “I was in equal error, taking\n",
       "you for this dead pagan.” So they swore friendship, and made a covenant\n",
       "of mutual help.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said Sir Artegall, “Tell me, sir, who were these knights that have\n",
       "come by this bad end?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“That I know not,” answered the prince, “but know that this damsel was\n",
       "in distress, and that I sought to succour her. But doubtless she herself\n",
       "will unfold the whole matter to us.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then the damsel told her story. “Know, sirs,” she said, “that I serve a\n",
       "maiden queen of these parts, Mercilla by name, a lady known far and\n",
       "wide, and envied also, for her prosperity and her goodness. Enemies she\n",
       "has, and chief among these is a pagan prince, who is bent on\n",
       "overthrowing her kingdom, yea, verily, and on slaying her sacred self.\n",
       "To this wickedness he is stirred up by his evil wife, Adikia[2] by name.\n",
       "’Tis she who, trusting in her power, moves him to all kinds of wrong.\n",
       "Now my liege lady, being desirous of peace, and willing for sake of it\n",
       "to give up something of her just right, sent me to make a treaty with\n",
       "this same Adikia, so that there might be quietness in the land. Now, as\n",
       "you know, it has been a custom of all time that such messengers have\n",
       "liberty to come and go without hindrance or harm. But this evil woman,\n",
       "without any offence given on my part, broke forth in railing upon me,\n",
       "and not only this, but thrust me from her door as if I were a dog. Yea,\n",
       "and when I had departed, she sent these two knights after me to take me\n",
       "prisoner. To you, therefore, for myself and for the queen, whose\n",
       "messenger I am, I render you most hearty thanks.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When they had heard the damsel’s story, the two knights, Sir Artegall\n",
       "and Prince Arthur, counselled together what should be done in this\n",
       "matter. Of which consultation the conclusion was that they should punish\n",
       "those who were guilty of this wrongdoing, that is to say the sultan and\n",
       "his wife and the knights who lent themselves to do their evil will.\n",
       "Further, they concluded to carry out this purpose in the way now to be\n",
       "described. Sir Artegall should disguise himself in the accoutrements of\n",
       "one of the dead pagan knights, and should take with him the damsel to\n",
       "the sultan’s court, making as though she was his prisoner.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Artegall therefore having donned the armour of one of the two\n",
       "knights, took the damsel with him, as being a prisoner, and so came to\n",
       "the sultan’s court. And the sultan’s wife, who chanced to be looking\n",
       "from the window, saw them, and did not doubt but that her errand had\n",
       "been performed, and sent a page who would show the knight what he should\n",
       "do. The page therefore brought them to the place appointed, but when he\n",
       "would have eased Sir Artegall of his armour, the knight refused, for he\n",
       "feared to be discovered.\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile Prince Arthur, coming to the gate of the city, sent to the\n",
       "sultan this message: “I demand that there be delivered to me the Lady\n",
       "Samient”—this was the damsel’s name—“being the ambassador of Queen\n",
       "Mercilla, whom you wrongfully detain in custody.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When the sultan heard this message, he was filled with anger, and\n",
       "commanded that his armour should be brought. This he straightway put on,\n",
       "and mounted his chariot. This same was armed in dreadful fashion with\n",
       "iron hooks and scythes, and was drawn by savage horses, whom he was wont\n",
       "to feed on the flesh of men. The poor wretches whom in his cruelty he\n",
       "slew, he was wont to give when they were but half dead to these beasts.\n",
       "In this guise he came forth from the city gates, where he found Prince\n",
       "Arthur awaiting him, mounted on his steed, with Talus standing at his\n",
       "stirrup.\n",
       "\n",
       "The sultan drove straight at his adversary, thinking to overthrow him by\n",
       "the rush of his chariot, and that his horses would trample him in the\n",
       "dust. But the prince perceiving his design, withdrew himself a pace, and\n",
       "so escaped the danger. Nor was he hurt by the dart which the sultan cast\n",
       "at him as he passed; this also he avoided, and it was well that he did\n",
       "so, else of a certainty it had pierced either him or his horse from side\n",
       "to side. But when Prince Arthur sought to approach the sultan, the\n",
       "horses carried the chariot out of his reach, so swift of foot were they.\n",
       "On the other hand, the sultan, having a store of darts ready to his hand\n",
       "in the chariot, cast them at the prince, and with one of them pierced\n",
       "the prince’s cuirass, and made a grievous wound in his side. So did the\n",
       "combat rage between these two, the prince being at this disadvantage\n",
       "also, that his horse could not endure the look of the sultan’s horses,\n",
       "so fierce and fiery of aspect were they. At the last, finding that all\n",
       "other means were of no avail, he drew the covering from his shield—a\n",
       "thing which he was not wont to do save in the last extremity—and held it\n",
       "so that the light shining from it fell full on the eyes of the sultan’s\n",
       "horses. As a flash of lightning did it fall upon them, and they\n",
       "straightway turned and fled. Nor could the sultan stay their flight. The\n",
       "reins were of no avail; they heeded them not; and when he called to\n",
       "them, they would not hear. Over hill and dale they carried him, he\n",
       "vainly dragging at the reins, and cursing aloud; while the chariot,\n",
       "swaying from side to side, tossed him to and fro. Still the prince\n",
       "followed close behind, but still found no opportunity to strike. Nor,\n",
       "indeed, had he need, for coming to some rocky ground, the horses overset\n",
       "the chariot, and the sultan was torn in pieces by his own contrivance of\n",
       "scythes and hooks. Then the prince took up his shield and armour from\n",
       "where they lay, sorely bent and broken, upon the ground. These he\n",
       "carried back to the city, and hanged them on a tree before the palace\n",
       "door. When the wicked wife saw what had happened, she ran down from her\n",
       "chamber like to one mad, saying to herself, “I will be avenged on that\n",
       "damsel who has brought upon me all this trouble.” And she ran, knife in\n",
       "hand, to the place where she had been put. But Sir Artegall stayed her\n",
       "hand. And she, being made yet more furious, ran forth into the woods,\n",
       "and there abode, in the form—so some men said—of a tigress. Sir Artegall\n",
       "meanwhile vanquished the sultan’s knights, and established a new order\n",
       "in the city.\n",

       "The two knights delivered the city, when they had ordered it anew, to\n",

       "departed on their own business, but Samient was not content that they\n",
       "should depart without seeing the queen, and this, overborne by her\n",
       "entreaties, they consented to do. As they journeyed, the damsel said to\n",
       "them: “There abides in this region a very sturdy villain, who is wont to\n",
       "rob all the country round about; and carries the spoil to a rock which\n",
       "he makes his dwelling, and to this place no man can get, so hard of\n",

       "that when he should come to see what was the cause of the disturbance,\n",
       "they should set upon him, and hinder his return. So the Lady Samient\n",
       "went to the cave, and there threw herself upon the ground, and then made\n",
       "a great uproar, with much wailing and many cries of grief. When the\n",
       "villain heard it he came forth from his den, thinking that something had\n",
       "come in his way. A dreadful creature he was to see, with hollow eyes,\n",
       "and long curling hair which fell over his shoulders, and a most uncouth\n",
       "and ragged garment. In his hand he carried a long staff with iron hooks\n",
       "at the end of it, and on his back he bore a wide net. This he used, not\n",
       "for fishing in the brook, but to catch such prey as he desired on the\n",
       "dry land, taking them unawares.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the damsel saw this strange creature standing close by her she was\n",
       "not a little dismayed, and cried out for help in good earnest. But he,\n",
       "with guileful words, would have persuaded her that she had nothing to\n",
       "fear; and then, while she listened, as she could scarce refrain from\n",
       "doing, suddenly he threw his net about her, and lifting her from the\n",
       "ground ran with her to his cave. But when, as he came near to the cave\n",
       "mouth, he saw the two knights barring the way, he threw down on the\n",
       "ground his net with its burden, and fled away: like to a wild goat did\n",
       "he leap from rock to rock, and he ran along the cliff-side without fear,\n",
       "into places where Sir Artegall, for all his courage, durst not follow\n",
       "him. So the knight sent his iron man, Talus, to follow him. And when the\n",
       "knave saw that the new-comer was not less swift of foot than he was\n",
       "himself, and did not grow weary or scant of breath, then he left running\n",
       "on the hills and came down again to the plain. And here he had recourse\n",
       "to a new device, changing himself into various shapes. First he made\n",
       "himself into a fox, but Talus was not slow to hunt him as a fox is\n",
       "hunted; then into a bush, but the iron man beat the bush with his flail;\n",
       "and from the bush he made himself into a bird, but Talus threw stones at\n",
       "the bird, and with so sure an aim that he soon brought it to the ground,\n",
       "as if it had been itself a stone. This Talus took from the ground and\n",
       "brought it to the knights, and gave it to Sir Artegall, saying at the\n",
       "same time: “Take it, Sir Knight, but beware! Hold it fast!” And lo! even\n",
       "while he held it fast, it was changed into a hedgehog, and pricked the\n",
       "knight’s hand so sorely that he threw it away. And the villain returned\n",
       "to his own shape and would have fled. But when Talus perceived it, he\n",
       "followed and overtook him and led him back. Then did he change himself\n",
       "into a snake; but this Talus struck so heavily with his iron flail that\n",
       "he broke all his bones, and left him dead for the fowls of the air to\n",
       "devour.\n",
       "\n",
       "After this they came to the palace of Queen Mercilla, as fair and noble\n",
       "a palace as was ever seen upon the earth. The porch stood open day and\n",
       "night, so that all comers might enter in. But a warder of giant form sat\n",
       "there, to keep from entering all that harboured guile or malice, and\n",
       "such as with flattery and dissembling work such harm in the courts of\n",
       "kings. The warder’s name was Awe. Such as were permitted to pass in were\n",
       "marshalled in the hall by another warder, whose name was Order. There\n",
       "they saw many noteworthy things, and chief of all the Queen Mercilla\n",
       "herself, where she sat on her throne, with a sceptre in her hand, a\n",
       "pledge of peace and clemency. And under her feet lay a great lion, very\n",
       "fierce of nature, but wholly tamed in that presence. So then the two did\n",
       "obeisance, and stood aside while the queen judged affairs of state, and\n",
       "ministered justice and equity to her people. Of all these affairs the\n",
       "chiefest was the trial of a great lady who stood before the throne, most\n",
       "fair and royally arrayed. Many accusations were brought against this\n",
       "lady, the prosecutor being one Zeal. Nor could this be wondered at, for\n",
       "this great lady was no other than the false Duessa. It was surely proved\n",

       "and even to death; also that she had wrought upon two vain knights,\n",
       "Blandamour and Paridell, to devise hostility against Queen Mercilla\n",
       "herself. Sir Artegall was so moved by these accusations that, being a\n",
       "lover of justice, he was firm in taking the contrary part against her.\n",

       "While the two knights tarried at the court of Queen Mercilla, being\n",
       "entertained by her in the most liberal fashion, there came two youths\n",
       "from a foreign land, praying for help for their mother, the Lady Belgé.\n",
       "It was a piteous story that they told before the Queen Mercilla and all\n",
       "the knights and ladies of her court. The Lady Belgé had been in former\n",
       "days among the most fortunate of women. She had to husband a most worthy\n",
       "and noble prince, of wide dominions and great wealth; she had also a\n",
       "very fair progeny, even seventeen sons, fair children, and of great\n",

       "not Niobé herself, before she moved the wrath of Apollo and Diana, was\n",
       "more blessed in her progeny. Now the beginning of troubles to this\n",
       "honourable lady was that her husband died in his prime, before any of\n",
       "his children had come to such an age that they could fill his place. And\n",
       "because the times were ill-suited to a woman’s rule, she was constrained\n",
       "to look for someone who should give her help and protection. Now there\n",
       "was in those parts a monstrous creature, Geryoneo by name, son of that\n",
       "Geryon who was slain by Hercules. He was terrible to look upon, and\n",
       "marvellously strong, for he had three bodies joined in one, the legs and\n",
       "arms of three men, as it were, to help him in the fighting. He, feigning\n",
       "himself to be just and kind, proffered his service to the Lady Belgé\n",
       "while she was yet in the first trouble of her widowhood, undertaking to\n",
       "defend her against all enemies both from within and from without. This\n",
       "proffer she gladly accepted, and he, for a time, kept the promise which\n",
       "he had made well and loyally. But having established himself in the\n",
       "country, and Belgé having given into his hands all the power, he began\n",
       "to bear himself most cruelly. Many wrongs did he do to this most unhappy\n",
       "lady, but of all the wrongs the worst was this, that he took of her\n",
       "children, one after another, to offer up in sacrifice to a horrible idol\n",
       "which he had made of his father Geryon. Twelve had he taken, one by one,\n",

       "now, all other hope having been lost, she bethought her of the gracious\n",
       "Queen Mercilla, and sent her two eldest sons to entreat her help.\n",
       "\n",
       "When they had told their story there was for a while silence in the\n",
       "court, no one caring to take this adventure upon himself. And when\n",
       "Prince Arthur saw that no one offered himself, he stood forth and said:\n",
       "“Grant me leave, gracious queen, to succour this distressed lady!”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Readily do I grant it,” said the queen. Thereupon he began straightway\n",
       "to prepare himself for his journey, for he would not lose time; even on\n",
       "the morrow would he start on this adventure. And so it was. So soon as\n",
       "the next morning came the prince set forth, not without gifts from the\n",
       "queen. Sir Artegall he left to follow his own business, but the two\n",
       "young sons of the Lady Belgé went with him, guiding him on his way.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was but a short journey to the place where the Lady Belgé dwelt. The\n",
       "tyrant had shut her out from the cities of her land, and from all the\n",
       "pleasant spots; she had her abode in the midst of marshes and fens, and\n",
       "was glad to find shelter in them from the cruelty of her oppressor. In\n",
       "such a dismal region did Prince Arthur find her, living quite alone, for\n",
       "her children had left her, seeking safety elsewhere. And she herself,\n",
       "when she caught sight of a man clad in armour, made ready to fly. But\n",
       "then, spying her own two sons, she took heart, and looked up joyfully,\n",
       "for she knew that the stranger was come to give her help. Then she threw\n",
       "her arms round the necks of the two lads as they knelt before her,\n",
       "crying, “Oh, my sweet boys, now I seem to live again, so joyful a thing\n",
       "is it to see you! Surely the sun shines brighter than its wont, thanks\n",
       "to your coming and to the presence of this noble knight.” Then turning\n",
       "to Prince Arthur she said: “Noble sir, who have taken all this trouble\n",
       "to help a miserable woman, may heaven reward you for your goodness.\n",
       "Reward have I none to give, for all that is left to me is bare life, and\n",
       "that life so full of misery that it is more like to a lingering death!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The prince was not a little moved at these sorrowful words, and sought\n",
       "to comfort her. “Take heart, dear lady,” he said, “for help is at hand,\n",
       "and these, your troubles, will have an end. But now come with me, and\n",
       "find some spot where you may more conveniently dwell than in this\n",
       "miserable place.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ah sir,” she answered, “to what place shall I go? The enemy dwells in\n",
       "my palaces, my cities are sacked, my towers are levelled with the\n",
       "ground, and what were abodes of men are fields where the wild flowers\n",
       "grow. Only these marshes, the abode of efts and frogs, are left to me.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay, good lady,” answered the prince, “think better things than these.\n",
       "We will find some place to harbour us. And if it yield not itself\n",
       "willingly, then will we compel it; for all that your adversary may do,\n",
       "we will purchase it with spear and shield; and if not, then the open\n",
       "field shall give us welcome; earth has a lodging for all its creatures.”\n",
       "With such words did the prince encourage her, so that she made ready to\n",

       "\n",
       "They set out therefore and came to a city which once had been the Lady\n",
       "Belgé’s own, but had been taken from her by her enemy. He had pulled\n",
       "down its stately towers, closed its harbour, marred the trade of its\n",
       "merchants, and brought its people to poverty. And he had built a great\n",
       "fort from which he dominated the place. For a while the city had\n",
       "resisted his tyranny, but had now submitted itself to him, so purchasing\n",
       "life, but losing all else that is worth the having. Many things did it\n",
       "suffer from his tyranny, but of all that it endured the worst was this,\n",
       "that it was compelled to offer sacrifices of human life to a hideous\n",
       "idol which the tyrant had set up in a chapel which he had built and\n",
       "adorned with costliest fittings of gold and ivory. In this city he had\n",
       "put a strong garrison, and in command of this garrison he had set a\n",
       "seneschal, a very stalwart knight, who had vanquished hitherto all the\n",
       "knights that had ventured to come against him. He had vanquished them,\n",
       "and when he had them in his power he had dealt with them in the most\n",

       "\n",
       "[Illustration: Prince Arthur slaying the Seneschal.]\n",
       "\n",
       "When the Lady Belgé knew the place, she said to the prince, “Oh, sir,\n",
       "beware what you venture; very many knights have been undone at this\n",
       "place.” To this warning he paid no heed, but riding up to the wall of\n",
       "the city, called to the watchmen, “I challenge to single combat the\n",
       "seneschal of this fortress.” Nor did the man delay to come, but donning\n",
       "his armour, rode forth from the city gate. The two combatants met in\n",
       "full tilt in the open field, charging each the other with his spear full\n",
       "upon the shield. But the spear of the seneschal made no way, of so pure\n",
       "and well-refined a metal was the prince’s shield. Broken was it into\n",
       "pieces without number. But the spear of the prince passed through the\n",
       "pagan’s cuirass, and made a deep wound in his body, so that he fell from\n",
       "his horse to the ground. There the prince left him to lie, for he was\n",
       "dead almost before he touched the ground, and rode straight to the\n",
       "fortress seeking entrance. But as he rode he spied three knights\n",
       "advancing towards him at the top speed of their horses. All three\n",
       "charged him at once, all aiming their spears at one place in his armour.\n",
       "But the prince did not swerve from his straight seat in his saddle, no,\n",
       "not by a hair’s-breadth. Firm as a tower he sat, and with his spear he\n",
       "smote that one of the three who had the middle place. Nor was his\n",
       "smiting in vain, for he drove the spear through the shield and through\n",
       "the side of the man, so that he fell dead straight-way on his\n",
       "mother-earth. When his fellows saw how easily he had been overcome, they\n",
       "fled away as fast as their steeds could carry them. But the prince\n",
       "followed yet faster, and overtook them hard by the city gate. There, as\n",
       "they hasted to enter, one hindered the other, and the prince slew the\n",
       "hindmost. The third, striving to shut the gate in his adversary’s face,\n",
       "was hindered by the carcase of his companion, for it lay in the way. So\n",
       "he fled into the hall which stood at the entering in of the gate, hoping\n",
       "so to save himself, but the prince following hard after him, slew him\n",
       "there. When they that were left of the garrison saw how it had gone with\n",
       "these three, they were sore afraid, and fled in great terror, escaping\n",
       "by a postern door. When the prince found no more to oppose him, he\n",
       "returned to the Lady Belgé, and brought her into the city, her two sons\n",
       "being with her. Many thanks did she render for the good service which he\n",
       "had done her.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the tidings of what had befallen the seneschal and his knights came\n",
       "to the sultan, he was carried out of himself with rage. Nevertheless\n",
       "there was something of fear mingled with his rage, for his conscience\n",
       "smote him with the thought that the recompense of his evil deeds was at\n",
       "hand. Nevertheless he comforted himself with this: “There is but one of\n",
       "them, and he cannot always prevail.” Therefore he armed himself: also he\n",
       "took with him all the followers that he had, and marched to the gate of\n",
       "the city, and there demanded entrance, saying, “Yield me up this place\n",
       "straightway, for it is my own.”\n",
       "\n",
       "To this summons the prince made no answer, but rode forth through the\n",
       "gate, ready armed for battle. And being on the farther side he said,\n",
       "“Are you he that has done all this wrong to the noble Lady Belgé,\n",
       "exiling her from her own land in such fashion that all the world cries\n",
       "shame on you?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The tyrant answered, “I stand on my own right; what I have done, that\n",
       "will I justify!” So saying he ran furiously at the prince, beating upon\n",
       "his armour with a great battle-axe as if he would have chopped it in\n",
       "pieces. So fierce was his onset that the prince was constrained to give\n",
       "place awhile. So heavy were his strokes, one had thought they would have\n",
       "riven a rock asunder. Also he had the advantage of his threefold form.\n",
       "Three pairs of hands he had, and he could shift his weapon from one to\n",
       "the other as occasion served. So crafty was he and so nimble, that an\n",
       "adversary scarce could know where and when he should defend himself. But\n",
       "the prince was his match and more. Ever he watched the motion of his\n",
       "hands, and parried the blow wherever it might fall. And the tyrant,\n",
       "being thus baffled again and again, roared for very rage, till, at the\n",
       "last, gathering up all the strength of the three bodies into one stroke,\n",
       "he thought to fell his adversary to the ground. What had happened had\n",
       "the stroke come upon the man none can say, but it lighted on the horse\n",
       "and brought him to the ground. So now the prince was constrained to\n",
       "fight on foot, and the giant laughed aloud to think that he had him at a\n",
       "disadvantage. But the fortune of the fight went not so. Now this arm and\n",
       "now that did the prince shear away with his good sword, and he himself\n",
       "was sheltered safe under his shield; so faultless was its temper, that\n",
       "no blow could shatter it. And ever the giant was more and more carried\n",
       "away by his rage, till, at the last, offering his whole side to the\n",
       "attack of the prince, he was brought to the ground a corpse, nay, three\n",
       "corpses, for all were smitten to death by the one stroke, and lay a\n",
       "bloody heap upon the plain.\n",
       "\n",
       "All this while the Lady Belgé watched the fortunes of the fight from the\n",
       "city wall, with her two sons standing on either hand. And when she saw\n",
       "the issue she hastened to greet him; the people of the city also, who\n",
       "had waited to see to whom the victory should fall, hastened to do him\n",
       "homage. Right glad were they to be rid of the giant’s tyranny.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the Lady Belgé had rendered the prince her thanks, which he\n",
       "received with due modesty—“’Tis not the strength nor courage of the\n",
       "doer,” said he, “but the justice of his deed that should be looked\n",
       "to”—she said: “O noble sir, you have freed me from my chief foe;\n",
       "nevertheless there remains yet something to be done. I pray you not to\n",
       "stay your victorious arms till you have rooted out all that remains of\n",
       "this vile brood, and established my peace for ever.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Tell me, lady,” he answered, “what is this that remains?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Sir,” she answered, “in this temple hard by there is, as you have\n",
       "heard, a monstrous idol which this tyrant set up, and to which he\n",
       "offered up sacrifices, taking, alas! of my dear children, and many\n",
       "children also of this people. Now in a cavern underneath this idol there\n",
       "lies a most hideous monster, which is wont to feed upon the flesh of\n",
       "these sacrifices. No man, they say, has ever looked upon its shape, so\n",
       "fearful is it, and lived.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When the prince heard this he was occupied with a great desire to deal\n",
       "with this same monster, and demanded that the queen should show him the\n",
       "place where it abode. “It is beneath the altar,” said she; and he\n",
       "uncovered his shield, for the need was such as to demand the help. The\n",
       "idol he saw, but not the monster. Then he took his sword, and with the\n",
       "naked blade he struck three times, as if in defiance, and at the third\n",
       "time the monster came from out its hiding-place. Hideous it was to see,\n",
       "huge of size, as long, it seemed, as the whole chapel, with the face of\n",
       "a woman and the body of a dog; its claws were like to lion’s claws; it\n",
       "had a tail with a deadly sting, and eagle’s wings. Nevertheless, for all\n",
       "its strength, it was dismayed to see the knight, and especially the\n",
       "burning brightness of his shield. It would have fled again to its\n",
       "hiding-place, but that the prince would not suffer. Seeing, then, that\n",
       "it had to fight, the monster flew at the prince’s shield, and caught it\n",
       "with its claws, purposing either to break it, or, if that might not be,\n",
       "to wrench it out of his hands. Long did they struggle together, but at\n",
       "the last the prince, with a stroke of his sword, shore off the monster’s\n",
       "claws. Exceeding loud was the bellowing which it made, seeming to make\n",
       "the whole chapel rock to its foundations. Next it struck at the prince\n",
       "with its great tail, and well-nigh brought him to the ground; but before\n",
       "it could strike a second blow, he had severed the last joint with his\n",
       "sword. Last of all, it raised itself on its great wings and flew at his\n",
       "head; doubtless it had hurt him sore but that he held his shield\n",
       "between. While he so warded off the attack, he struck full at the\n",
       "monster’s belly, and so did it to death.\n",

       "While these things were doing, Sir Artegall set forth to accomplish his\n",
       "task, having Talus with him as before. After he had journeyed awhile, he\n",
       "overtook an old man who was travelling alone, and perceived that he was\n",
       "the same that had attended the Lady Irene when she came to the court of\n",
       "Queen Gloriana. He had been a famous knight in his day, but had long\n",
       "since foregone the use of arms, being stricken with age.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hail, Sir Sergis,” he cried, “there lives no truer knight, I know; but\n",
       "tell me, what is your errand? How fares the Lady Irene? How comes it\n",
       "that you have left her? Is she in prison? Does she yet live?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“She lives,” answered the old knight, “but she is in sore trouble.\n",
       "Trusting to your promise that you would come to be her champion, and do\n",
       "battle with him who was oppressing her, she came at the appointed time,\n",
       "but found you not. And now Grantorto has thrown her into prison, and has\n",
       "appointed her a day, saying that if by that time no champion shall\n",
       "appear to justify her and prove her clear of the crimes of which she is\n",
       "accused, she shall suffer death.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Artegall was sorely troubled to hear these words, knowing that she\n",
       "suffered these things through his default. “Verily,” he said, “I am to\n",
       "blame for this fair maiden’s trouble, in that I was not present to\n",
       "maintain her cause; but, as you know, I was not wholly to blame for that\n",
       "which hindered me. But tell me, how many days has the tyrant allowed for\n",
       "the finding of this champion?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Ten days he has given,” answered the old knight, “but he knows that\n",
       "’tis only a form, for he guards all the coasts and approaches by which\n",
       "such a champion might come. Indeed, he counts her to be already dead.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Turn again, dear knight,” said Sir Artegall; “surely, if I live, she\n",
       "shall have the champion whom she needs within the appointed time!” So\n",
       "they two went on together.\n",
       "\n",
       "As they rode they were aware of a great rout of people who seemed to be\n",
       "looking on at some affray. Coming nearer, they perceived a number of\n",
       "rude fellows setting on a single knight, and chasing him to and fro as\n",
       "if they would make him prisoner. And he, on the other hand, sought to\n",
       "make his way to a lady who might be seen in another part of the field,\n",
       "holding up her hands and praying for help. Wheresoever he turned they\n",
       "gave way before him, yet ever returned and renewed their attack, and, so\n",
       "great were their numbers, pressed him sorely. So harassed was he with\n",
       "their assailing, that he threw away his shield, a most dishonourable\n",
       "thing for any knight to do, and one that marks him with shame without\n",
       "end. When Sir Artegall saw in what an evil plight the man stood, he rode\n",
       "forward to his help, yet he was himself so rudely assailed that he was\n",
       "constrained to give place for a while. But when Talus began to use his\n",
       "iron flail, then the multitude fled for their lives, being scattered as\n",
       "the wind scatters the chaff on a threshing-floor. When the knight had\n",
       "given thanks for his deliverance, Sir Artegall said to him:\n",
       "\n",
       "“What is the occasion of this uproar? Who are you, and who are these\n",
       "villains that attacked you so furiously?”\n",
       "\n",
       "The knight answered: “My name is Burbon; I have won honour as a knight,\n",
       "and have been in good repute till of late trouble has overtaken me. This\n",
       "lady is by name Fleur de Lys; my love she is, though of late she has\n",
       "scorned me; I know not whether by her own choice or by constraint of\n",
       "others. It cannot be denied that she was once betrothed to me of her own\n",
       "free choice; but a certain tyrant, whom men call Grantorto, won her by\n",
       "gifts and lying words. This host of villains he sent to take her away\n",
       "from me by open force.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said Sir Artegall: “I see, Sir Knight, that you have suffered\n",
       "grievous things, yet not without fault of your own. But let us first rid\n",
       "you of these villains. That done, we can make a settlement of other\n",
       "matters.”\n",
       "\n",
       "This then they did, Talus greatly helping with his flail. But when they\n",
       "came to the lady, who had been left by them who had taken her prisoner,\n",
       "they were in no little doubt in what mind she was, for she seemed to be\n",
       "neither glad nor sorry. One thing was certain, to wit, that she was\n",
       "wondrous fair and clad in splendid robes. When Sir Burbon, lighting from\n",
       "his horse, ran to her and would have clasped her in his arms, she turned\n",
       "from him in high disdain. “Begone,” she cried, “and touch me not.” Then\n",
       "said Sir Artegall: “Fair lady, you cast a very great blemish on your\n",
       "beauty, if you change a plighted faith. Is there aught on earth so dear\n",
       "and so precious as faith and honour? Love surely is dearer than life,\n",
       "and fame is more to be desired than gold; but a plighted troth is more\n",
       "to be honoured than even love or fame.” At this rebuke the lady seemed\n",
       "much abashed, and Sir Burbon, lifting her in his arms, set her on her\n",
       "steed, nor did she repulse him. So they rode away, but whether wholly\n",
       "agreed or not, no one can say.\n",
       "\n",
       "These matters being accomplished, Sir Artegall with Sir Sergis pursued\n",
       "his journey till they came to the seashore. There by good fortune they\n",
       "found a ship ready equipped for sailing. This they hired, that it should\n",
       "take them whither they would, and embarking in it, found wind and\n",
       "weather serve them so well that in a single day they came to the land\n",
       "which they sought. There they saw drawn up on the shore great hosts of\n",
       "men who should hinder them from landing. But they did not for this\n",
       "forego their purpose. So soon as they approached so near to the shore\n",
       "that they could see the bottom beneath the waves, Talus leapt from the\n",
       "ship into the sea. The enemy sought to overwhelm him with stones and\n",
       "darts, but he heeded them not at all. Wading through the waves he came\n",
       "to the shore, and once having put his foot upon the land, chased all the\n",
       "multitude away, even as an eagle chases a flock of doves. The way being\n",
       "thus made clear, for there was now no one to hinder them, Sir Artegall\n",
       "and the old knight landed, and made their way to a city that was hard\n",
       "by. The tyrant Grantorto, being made aware of their coming by some of\n",
       "those that had fled from Talus, gathered a host of men and came against\n",
       "them. But these also did Talus discomfit with his flail, pursuing them\n",
       "till Artegall himself bade him hold his hand, for he would settle the\n",
       "quarrel in more orderly fashion. Therefore he called a herald and bade\n",
       "him take a message to King Grantorto to this purport:\n",
       "\n",
       "“I came not hither to fight against your people, but to maintain the\n",
       "cause of the Lady Irene against you in single combat. Do you therefore\n",
       "call your people back that they may suffer no further damage, but fix a\n",
       "time and place for us two to fight together in the cause of the Lady\n",
       "Irene.”\n",
       "\n",
       "That night he pitched his tent outside the city, and would suffer none\n",
       "to come near him; only Sir Sergis kept him company, and gave such\n",
       "services as were needful. Now the Lady Irene had not heard of the coming\n",
       "of Sir Artegall, and this being the day on which, lacking a champion who\n",
       "should defend her cause, it was appointed for her to die, she arrayed\n",
       "herself in squalid garments, fit for such occasion, and prepared herself\n",
       "for her doom. But her mood was changed to joy when, coming to the\n",
       "appointed place, she found Sir Artegall ready to do battle for her.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now, the lists having been made ready, Grantorto came forth prepared\n",
       "for battle. He was clad in armour of iron, with a steel cap, rusty brown\n",
       "in colour, on his head, and in his hand he carried a huge pole-axe. He\n",
       "was of mighty stature, standing up as a giant among other men, and\n",
       "hideous of aspect. Very expert in arms was he, and of great strength; no\n",
       "man had ever stood against him in fight and held his own.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then the trumpets sounded and the two met. Fast and furiously did\n",
       "Grantorto rain his blows upon his adversary. This was his manner of\n",
       "fighting, to wit, to overbear his foe by the fierceness of his attack,\n",
       "giving him no respite or breathing-time. But of this Sir Artegall was\n",
       "well aware, and bore himself accordingly. It was as when a sailor sees a\n",
       "storm approaching and strikes his sails and loosens his main-sheet. So\n",
       "did Sir Artegall stoop his head, shunning the great shower of blows.\n",
       "Small shame it is to stoop if a man shall thereafter raise his head the\n",
       "higher. For a time, indeed, it might seem that the tyrant would prevail,\n",
       "so heavy was the shower of blows that he poured upon him, and so many\n",
       "the wounds which the great pole-axe made even through his armour. But\n",
       "ere long the occasion came for which the knight had waited. When the\n",
       "tyrant raised his arm high to strike what should be, he hoped, a mortal\n",
       "blow, Sir Artegall smote under his guard and drove his sword deep into\n",
       "his flank, so that the blood gushed forth in a great stream. Meanwhile\n",
       "the blow of the pole-axe had fallen, and, despite the shield which the\n",
       "knight had raised to defend his head, had bitten so deep that the giant\n",
       "could by no means loose it again. Then Sir Artegall let go his shield,\n",
       "and struck Grantorto on the head with such strength that he brought him\n",
       "to the ground, and, as he lay, with yet another stroke severed his head\n",
       "from his body.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then all the people, glad to be rid of the tyrant, joyfully hastened to\n",
       "pay their homage to Queen Irene. So she was established on her throne.\n",
       "Sir Artegall tarried awhile to order all things in peace and justice,\n",
       "Talus helping much in the seeking out and punishment of offenders.\n",

       "\n",

       "certain Sir Calidore, who was in high repute among the knights and dames\n",
       "of Fairyland for his courtesy and honesty. These two had been friends in\n",
       "old time, and now were right glad to meet.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Hail, noble sir,” said Sir Calidore, “tell me, I pray you, how you have\n",
       "prospered in your enterprise.”\n",
       "\n",
       "And when the other had unfolded the whole matter in order, what\n",
       "hindrances he had encountered, and what success he had achieved in the\n",
       "end, “Happy man,” he said, “that have accomplished so great an\n",
       "enterprise! You are at the end of your labours, but I am but beginning\n",
       "mine, nor do I know where to begin; the way is all untried. I know not\n",
       "what dangers await me, nor what provision I must make.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“What, then, is this enterprise of yours?” said Sir Artegall.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I pursue,” answered the other, “the Blatant Beast, a monster that,\n",
       "having been nurtured in the regions below, has now come forth on the\n",
       "earth to be the plague and bane of men. My task is to follow him, if\n",
       "need be, all over the world, till I can destroy him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Such a creature I myself saw,” said Sir Artegall, “after that I left\n",
       "the Savage Island. It seemed to have full a thousand tongues, and with\n",
       "all of these it bayed and barked at me; I heeded him not, and this\n",
       "seemed to move him to still greater rage.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Doubtless,” answered Sir Calidore, “that is the monster which I\n",
       "follow.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Go on and prosper,” said Sir Artegall; and so they parted in all\n",
       "friendship and amity.\n",
       "\n",
       "After Sir Calidore had travelled a mile or so, he came upon a squire, a\n",
       "comely youth to behold, whom his enemies had bound to a tree. The same\n",
       "loudly called on him for help, which he, without waiting to ask\n",
       "questions, promptly rendered. When he had loosed his bonds he said:\n",
       "“Tell me, unhappy man, how you came into this evil plight; who was it\n",
       "that captured you and bound you in this fashion?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Sir Knight,” said the man, “be assured that it was by misfortune only,\n",
       "not by fault committed, that I came into this condition. Not far from\n",
       "this place there is a very strong castle, where they keep this evil\n",
       "custom. No man may pass along the road—and the road so lies that none\n",
       "may pass without leave obtained from them who hold the castle—without\n",
       "payment of toll. And the toll is this—from every lady her hair, and from\n",
       "every knight his beard.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“As shameful a custom as ever came to my ears!” cried Sir Calidore, “and\n",
       "one speedily to be overthrown! But tell me how it came about, and what\n",
       "was its beginning?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“In this castle,” the squire made reply, “there dwells a certain lady,\n",
       "Briana by name; there is no one on earth more proud, and it vexes her\n",
       "sorely that she loves a certain Sir Crudor, and that he will not deign\n",
       "to return love for love, until she shall make for him a mantle lined\n",
       "with the hair of ladies and the beards of knights. And she to gain this\n",
       "end uses the castle, having for her minister in the matter a certain\n",
       "Maleffort, who, indeed, does her will in the most cruel fashion. This\n",
       "very day, as I journeyed by the road with the lady whom I love, this\n",
       "Maleffort made an assault upon us. Me first he took prisoner, for I\n",
       "could not withstand him, so strong was he. This done, he pursued the\n",
       "damsel, binding me to this tree until he should come back. But whether\n",
       "he has found her or not, I know not.”\n",
       "\n",
       "While he was yet speaking, they heard a loud shriek from hard by, and\n",
       "looking to the place saw the knave holding a lady by her garments and\n",
       "about to shear the tresses from her head. When Sir Calidore saw this he\n",
       "was greatly moved with wrath; the squire he left, and turned to pursue\n",
       "the villain. “Hold!” he cried, “leave that evil doing, and turn to\n",
       "answer me!”\n",
       "\n",
       "The fellow, trusting in his strength, which, indeed, had never failed\n",
       "him, answered him scornfully. “Who,” said he, “are you that defy me in\n",
       "this fashion? You take this maiden’s part; will you then give your\n",
       "beard, though it be but little, for her locks? Nay, nay, you may not\n",
       "purchase them so cheaply.” So saying he ran at Sir Calidore in a mighty\n",
       "rage, and rained upon him a great shower of blows. The knight, who was\n",
       "well skilled in arms, held back awhile, standing on his defence, and let\n",
       "him spend his strength. But when he perceived that he was failing\n",
       "somewhat, then he began to press him; the more he gave way the more\n",
       "strongly he assailed him. At last the fellow lost heart, and turned to\n",
       "fly, hoping to gain the castle and find shelter. So he fled, Sir\n",
       "Calidore pursuing; and now he had reached the gate and cried aloud that\n",
       "they should open to him without delay. This indeed they who were within,\n",
       "seeing in what extremity he was, made haste to do, but even as he stood\n",
       "in the porch Sir Calidore dealt him a mighty blow with his sword, and\n",
       "cleft his head from the crown to the chin. He fell down dead where he\n",
       "stood, and when they would have shut the gate, they could not, for the\n",
       "carcase blocked the way, and Sir Calidore entering in, slew the porter\n",
       "where he stood. Then all who were in the castle set at him, but in vain;\n",
       "he swept them aside full easily, as an ox, standing in a meadow on a\n",
       "summer day, sweeps away the flies which trouble him. So he passed from\n",
       "the porch into the hall, where the Lady Briana met him, and assailed him\n",
       "with angry words, calling him villain because he had slain her steward,\n",
       "and was now come to rob her of her possessions.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay, nay, fair lady,” he made answer, “I deserve not these reproaches.\n",
       "I came to abate an evil custom that you wot of. Such things do dishonour\n",
       "to the laws of courtesy. I pray you, therefore, of your own accord, to\n",
       "do away with this evil. Rather show kindness and hospitality to all such\n",
       "as pass by this way; so shall you gain a glory that is better far than\n",
       "earthly love.”\n",
       "\n",
       "These words did but make her wrath more strong. “Know, sir,” she cried,\n",
       "“that I disdain all this talk of kindness and courtesy, and defy you to\n",
       "the death.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I hold it no shame,” answered Sir Calidore, “to take defiance from a\n",
       "lady; but were there one here who would abide the trial with his sword,\n",
       "gladly would I prove my words upon him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then the lady in great haste called to her a dwarf who served her, and\n",
       "taking from her hand a ring of gold, gave it to him, saying: “Take this\n",
       "with all speed to Sir Crudor; and tell him that there is a knight here\n",
       "who has slain my steward and done much damage to my people;” for it had\n",
       "been agreed between them, that when urgent need should arise she should\n",
       "send this ring. So the dwarf departed with the ring, and travelled all\n",
       "that night. Meanwhile Sir Calidore abode in the castle, the lady being\n",
       "now scornful, now angry, and he enduring her moods with all patience and\n",
       "courtesy.\n",
       "\n",
       "The next day, before the sun rose, came the dwarf, bringing a message\n",
       "from Sir Crudor that he would come to her help before he had broken his\n",
       "fast, and would deliver to her the enemy alive or dead; and he sent his\n",
       "helmet as a true token. Greatly did the Lady Briana rejoice to have such\n",
       "news, and behaved herself more scornfully than ever to Sir Calidore. He\n",
       "took no heed of her ways, rather rejoicing that he should have someone\n",
       "with whom to settle this quarrel. So he donned his arms, and waited for\n",
       "the coming of Sir Crudor. Nor did he wait long. Right soon did he espy a\n",
       "knight riding across the plain. “This,” said he to himself, “is the Lady\n",
       "Briana’s champion,” and without staying to ask of anyone who this\n",
       "new-comer might be, he rode forth to meet him. The two came together in\n",
       "the middle of the plain with so strong a shock that both were rolled\n",
       "upon the ground, each rider with his horse. Sir Calidore rose lightly\n",
       "from the ground, while his adversary still lay without sense or speech,\n",
       "but he disdained to do him any damage; it would ill become a courteous\n",
       "knight to strike a sleeping foe. But Briana, where she stood upon the\n",
       "castle walls, thought that her champion was dead, and loudly bemoaned\n",
       "him, and made as if she would throw herself from the walls to the earth.\n",
       "\n",
       "After a while Sir Crudor raised himself from the ground, but in listless\n",
       "fashion, like to one who can scarcely rouse himself from sleep. But when\n",
       "he saw his adversary, his spirit returned to him as before, and he\n",
       "renewed the fight, hoping that he would fare better on foot than he had\n",
       "fared on horseback. Long did they fight, dealing each to other fearful\n",
       "blows. Not once, so fierce were they, did they pause to take rest. At\n",
       "the last, when, as if by common consent, both lifted their swords high\n",
       "in the air to deal what might be a final blow, and so finish the fight,\n",
       "either for this champion or for that, Sir Calidore, being more nimble\n",
       "and quicker of sight than his adversary, was beforehand with him, and\n",
       "struck him with so sharp a blow upon his helmet that he brought him to\n",
       "his knee. Nor did he fail to follow up his advantage, but redoubling the\n",
       "fierceness of his strokes, brought him altogether to the ground. As he\n",
       "lay there he would have unlaced his helmet, and given him his\n",
       "death-blow, but the vanquished man begged for mercy. Then Sir Calidore,\n",
       "mastering his anger, such was his courtesy, said: “Mercy I grant with\n",
       "all goodwill. Do you learn not to treat strangers with such rudeness.\n",
       "This ill befits a knight, for his first duty is to conquer himself. And\n",
       "now I give you your life on these conditions, that you help to the best\n",
       "of your power all wandering knights, and also give aid as you can to all\n",

       "his liege lord for all his life. All this time the Lady Briana was\n",
       "looking in great dismay and trouble of mind; and now Sir Calidore,\n",
       "bidding her to approach, told all that had been agreed between him and\n",
       "Sir Crudor. She was overcome by so great a courtesy, and thanked him\n",
       "with all her heart, for indeed it was in her inmost heart that she was\n",
       "moved. She threw herself at his feet, and declared herself to be wholly\n",
       "bound to him. After this they all betook themselves to the castle, where\n",

       "As Sir Calidore went on his way he saw a young man of great stature\n",
       "fighting on foot with a knight on horseback. Not far from these two\n",
       "stood a lady, clad in very poor array. Sir Calidore would have inquired\n",
       "of her the cause of the strife, having it in his mind to part the two\n",
       "combatants, if this might be done. But before he could come at the\n",
       "place, the youth had slain the knight, a thing at which he wondered not\n",
       "a little. This same youth was very goodly to look at, slender in shape,\n",
       "and of but seventeen years or so, as it seemed, but tall and fair of\n",
       "face. He was clad in a woodman’s jacket of Lincoln green, embroidered\n",
       "with silver, with a huntsman’s horn hanging by his side. He had a dart\n",
       "in his right hand, and in his left a boar-spear.\n",
       "\n",
       "“What means this?” said Sir Calidore. “You, who are no knight, have\n",
       "slain a knight, a thing plainly contrary to the law of arms.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“I would not wish,” answered the youth, “to break the law of arms; yet\n",
       "would I break it again, sooner than suffer such wrong as I have of this\n",
       "man, so long as I have two hands wherewith to defend myself. The quarrel\n",
       "with him was not of my seeking, as this lady can testify.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Tell me therefore,” said Sir Calidore, “how things fell out.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Sir Knight,” answered the lad, “I was hunting in the wood, as I am wont\n",
       "to do for lack of graver employment, for which my years are not fit,\n",
       "when I saw this knight, who lies dead yonder, passing over the plain,\n",
       "with this lady in his company. He was on horseback, but she followed on\n",
       "foot, and when she lagged behind, as she must needs do, so rough was the\n",
       "ground, then he smote her with the butt of his spear, taking no heed of\n",
       "her tears and prayers. This sight I saw with no small indignation, and\n",
       "being moved with wrath said: ‘Surely, Sir Knight, you should rather\n",
       "takeup this lady to ride behind you than make her travel so uneasily.’\n",
       "To this he answered in angry words, bidding me hold my peace, nor meddle\n",
       "with things that concerned me not. ‘Or,’ said he, ‘I will whip you as a\n",
       "malapert boy should be whipped!’ So after some angry talk, he struck me\n",
       "twice with his spear, and I threw at him a dart, fellow of this which\n",
       "you see here in my hand; nor did I throw it in vain, for it struck him\n",
       "beneath the heart so hard that presently he died.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Calidore was not a little pleased with his manner of speech, so bold\n",
       "and honest was it, and he admired also the sturdiness of the stroke\n",
       "which had broken to such effect the coat of mail. And when, after\n",
       "question put to the lady, he found that it was even as the lad had told,\n",
       "he said: “I do not condemn this youth, but rather hold him free of\n",
       "blame. ’Tis the duty of knights, and indeed of all men, to bear\n",
       "themselves kindly and courteously to women, and he did well to maintain\n",
       "this good custom. But now I would have you tell me, lady, if you will,\n",
       "how it came about that the man whom he slew treated you in so unseemly a\n",
       "fashion?”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Sir Knight,” answered the lady, “I am loath to bring accusations\n",
       "against the dead; yet I must needs declare the truth. This day, as this\n",
       "knight and I were passing on our way, we came upon a glade in the wood\n",
       "where there sat two lovers, a comely knight and a fair lady. The knight\n",
       "my companion being taken with the lady’s beauty, bade me dismount. And\n",
       "when I was unwilling to do so, thrust me out of my seat with violence.\n",
       "Which when he had done, he said to the other: ‘Now, yield me up that\n",
       "dame!’ And when the other—though, indeed, he was not prepared for\n",
       "battle—refused, then he wounded him sorely with his spear. This he did,\n",
       "though the other had proffered to do battle with him, if only he would\n",
       "appoint a day when they might try their strength on equal terms.\n",
       "Meanwhile the lady had fled into the wood, and had hidden herself to\n",
       "such good purpose, that when my knight sought to find her, he spent all\n",
       "his labour in vain. At this baulk he was greatly enraged. He would not\n",
       "set me on his horse again, but constrained me to follow on foot, smiting\n",
       "me with his spear if ever I lagged behind, and taking no heed of my\n",
       "tears and complaining. So we went on till we fell in with this young\n",
       "man, and he, being moved with pity at my evil plight, rebuked the\n",
       "knight. How the matter ended you have seen for yourself.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“This boor has received his due,” said Calidore. Then turning to the\n",
       "lad, he said: “Tell me now who you are, and how you came to be in this\n",
       "place. Never did I see greater promise in anyone, and I would help you\n",
       "to bring it to as good fulfilment as may be.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Sir Knight,” the youth made answer, “it may be that the revealing of my\n",
       "name and lineage may be to my hurt, for of such danger I have been\n",
       "warned; nevertheless, so courteously have you borne yourself to me, that\n",
       "I will tell you the whole truth. I am a Briton, Tristram by name, son of\n",
       "good King Meliogras, who once reigned in the land of Cornwall. He dying\n",
       "while I was yet of tender years, his brother took the kingdom. Thereupon\n",
       "my mother, Queen Emiline, conceiving me to be in danger from this same\n",
       "uncle, thought it best to send me into some foreign land, where I should\n",
       "not be within his reach, if the thought of doing me a mischief should\n",
       "arise in his heart. So, according to the counsel of a wise man of whom\n",
       "she inquired in her perplexity, she sent me from the land of Lyonesse,\n",
       "where I was born, to the land of Fairy, where, no one knowing who or\n",
       "what I was, none would seek to do me wrong. I was then ten years of age,\n",
       "and I have abode in this land ever since, not wasting my days in vain\n",
       "delights, but perfecting myself in all the arts of hunting. But now it\n",
       "is time, I hold, to look to higher things. Therefore, this being such an\n",
       "occasion as might not again befall, I would entreat of you that you\n",
       "advance me, unworthy though I be, to a squire’s degree, so that I may\n",
       "duly learn and practise all the use of arms. And for this I have this\n",
       "beginning, to wit, the arms of this knight, whom I slew in fair\n",
       "encounter.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Calidore answered, “Fair child, I would not by any means baulk this\n",

       "wish that I could set you to some service that should be worthy of you.\n",
       "Kneel therefore and swear that you will be faithful to any knight whom\n",
       "you shall serve as squire, and be true to all ladies, and never draw\n",
       "back from fear of any deed that it may be fitting for you to do.” So\n",
       "Tristram knelt down upon his knees, and took his oath to do according to\n",
       "these words.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thereupon Sir Calidore dubbed him a squire, and he bloomed forth\n",
       "straightway in all joy and gladness, even as a bud opens into a flower.\n",

       "adventure, vowing that he would follow him to the death, Sir Calidore\n",
       "answered: “I should be right glad, most courteous squire, to have you\n",
       "with me, so that I might see the valour which you have show itself in\n",
       "honourable achievement, but this may not be. I am bound by vow to my\n",
       "sovereign, who set me this task to accomplish, that I would not take\n",
       "anyone to aid me. For this reason I may not grant your request. But now,\n",
       "seeing that this lady is left desolate, and is in need of safe convoy,\n",
       "you will do well to succour her in this her need.”\n",
       "\n",
       "This service the youth gladly undertook, and Sir Calidore, taking leave\n",
       "of him and the dame in courteous fashion, set forth again on his quest.\n",
       "He had not travelled far before he came to the place where the knight\n",
       "who had been so discourteously treated by him whom Tristram had slain,\n",
       "lay in a most sorrowful plight. He was bleeding from many wounds, so\n",
       "that all the earth about him was red; and the lady sat by him weeping,\n",
       "and yet doing all that she could with careful hands to dress his wounds\n",
       "and ease his pain. Sir Calidore, when he saw this sorry sight, was\n",
       "well-nigh moved to tears; from which, scarce refraining himself, he\n",
       "said: “Tell me, sad lady, if your grief will suffer you, who it was that\n",
       "with cruel hand wrought such mischief to a knight unarmed, for surely,\n",
       "if I may but come near him, I will avenge this wrong upon him.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The lady answered: “Fair sir, this knight whom you see here and I sat\n",
       "talking in lover’s fashion, and this man charged him, unarmed as he was,\n",
       "and dealt him these deadly wounds. And if you would know what manner of\n",
       "man he was, he was of tall stature, clad in gilded armour, crossed with\n",
       "a band of blue, and for device on his shield he had a lady rowed in a\n",
       "summer barge across rough waves.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When Sir Calidore heard this, he was assured that this indeed was the\n",
       "knight whom Tristram had slain, and he said: “Lady, take to yourself\n",
       "this comfort, that he who so foully wronged your knight lies now in yet\n",
       "more evil case. I saw him with my own eyes lying dead upon the earth, a\n",
       "just recompense for the foul wrong that he did to your fair knight. And\n",
       "now bethink you what we may best do for this wounded man, how you may\n",
       "best convey him hence, and to what refuge.”\n",
       "\n",
       "She thanked him for his courtesy and friendly care, yet knew not what to\n",
       "say, for being a stranger in that country she could not think of a\n",
       "fitting place, nor could she ask him to carry the wounded man. This he\n",
       "did not fail to perceive, and said: “Fair lady, think not that I deem it\n",
       "a disgrace to carry this burden; gladly will I help you.” Taking\n",
       "therefore his shield, and first pouring the healing balm, which he\n",
       "always carried with him for such needs, into the knight’s wounds, he put\n",
       "him thereon, and bare him, the lady helping, to a castle that was hard\n",
       "by. And it so chanced that the lord of this castle was father to the\n",
       "wounded knight, a man far advanced in years, who had been a famous\n",
       "man-at-arms in the days gone by, and was of most courteous and\n",
       "hospitable temper. Aldus was his name, and his son’s name was Aladine.\n",
       "Great was his grief when he saw his dear son brought home in such a\n",
       "plight.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Dear boy,” he cried, “and is the pleasure with which I thought to\n",
       "welcome you to this your home turned to such sorrow!” Nevertheless he\n",
       "put a brave constraint upon his sorrow, and turned himself to entertain\n",
       "his guests with all hospitality. To this welcome Sir Calidore made a\n",
       "courteous return, but the lady, whose name was Priscilla, could not by\n",
       "any means be cheered. She was daughter to a noble lord that dwelt hard\n",
       "by, and had seen and loved this same Aladine, though he was of meaner\n",
       "birth and smaller estate; and now she was much troubled, thinking both\n",
       "of her lover’s perilous state and of how her father would take the\n",
       "matter. So, while Sir Aldus entertained Sir Calidore, she sat and tended\n",
       "the wounded man, and at the last, with infinite pains, brought him out\n",
       "of the swoon in which he lay, and restored him to himself.\n",
       "\n",
       "The next day, when Sir Calidore came to see how the wounded man was\n",
       "faring, he found him not a little bettered in state of body, but anxious\n",
       "in mind, especially for his lady’s sake, because of the displeasure\n",
       "which her father might have concerning her love for him. Thereupon he\n",
       "told to Sir Calidore the whole story of his love, and besought his help,\n",
       "which he, much moved by pity for their sorrowful case, gladly promised\n",
       "that he would give. This promise he most fully did perform. First he\n",
       "went to where the carcase of that misbehaved knight lay upon the ground,\n",
       "and shore the head from the body. This he took in his hand, and brought\n",
       "the lady to her father’s house. He, indeed, was greatly troubled to\n",
       "think what had befallen his child, and was much rejoiced to see her\n",
       "again safe and sound.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said Sir Calidore: “Your daughter was like to suffer wrong from an\n",
       "evil knight; but he suffered for his evil intent—lo! here you see his\n",
       "head.”\n",
       "\n",

       "which there was great store, wandered away.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thereupon the Blatant Beast, the same monster which Sir Calidore had it\n",
       "in charge to seek, rushed out of a wood that was hard by, caught her in\n",
       "his mouth, and carried her away. She cried aloud to the two knights for\n",
       "help, and they, hearing her voice, started up to succour her. Sir\n",
       "Calidore, being the more swift of foot of the two, overtook the beast\n",
       "before it had gone far. Thereupon it cast down the lady out of its mouth\n",
       "and fled. Nor did Sir Calidore delay to pursue the beast. “The lady,”\n",
       "said he to himself, “will be cared for by her own knight; but as for me,\n",
       "I must not abandon my quest.” How he fared in the pursuit will be told\n",

       "both sides by the monster’s teeth, so that she lay upon the ground in a\n",
       "swoon, as if she were dead. With much ado he brought her back to life,\n",
       "and, setting her on his horse, held her up with his arms, till they\n",
       "could find some place where she might rest and be healed of her wounds.\n",
       "So they journeyed till they came to a river, on the other side of which\n",
       "stood a fair castle, in which he hoped that he might find shelter. But\n",
       "when he came to the water’s edge he found that the stream could scarce\n",
       "be forded on foot. While he doubted what it were best to do, there came\n",
       "a knight to the river’s side, with a lady riding on a palfrey by his\n",
       "side. Thereupon Sir Calepine, with all due courtesy, made a request of\n",
       "the new-comer, that he would take this wounded lady to the other side.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Not so,” replied the other; “if you have no horse of your own you shall\n",
       "have no help of mine. Go on foot, and let this lady do the same. Or, if\n",
       "you like it better, carry her on your back, and so prove yourself a\n",
       "man.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The lady on the palfrey was much displeased at the rudeness of this\n",
       "speech, and, pitying the plight of Serena, would have helped her with\n",
       "her own palfrey. For this courtesy Sir Calepine thanked her, but, being\n",
       "very angry with the knight, would have none of her help. Stepping down,\n",
       "therefore, into the river, he held himself up against the stream with\n",
       "his spear in one hand, and with the other hand stayed the lady on his\n",
       "horse. All the while the discourteous knight stood on the bank jeering\n",
       "and laughing.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Sir Calepine had won in safety to the farther bank, he called aloud\n",
       "to the other, saying, “Unknightly man, disgrace to all who bear arms, I\n",
       "defy you. Fight if you dare, or never be bold to bear arms again.” But\n",
       "the fellow took no heed of this challenge, but laughed aloud, as if to\n",
       "say that his adversary was of so mean estate that a man of honour need\n",
       "not trouble to regard his words. So, crossing the stream, he came to the\n",
       "fair house on the farther bank, for indeed this was his house.\n",
       "\n",
       "To this same house came Sir Calepine, for indeed there was no other\n",
       "house where he could find shelter, and asked admittance for the lady’s\n",
       "sake. But the porter said: “We find no lodging here for any wandering\n",
       "knight, unless he is willing first to fight with the master of the\n",
       "house.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“And who is he?” said Sir Calepine.\n",
       "\n",
       "“His name,” answered the porter, “is Sir Turpin; a mighty man and a\n",
       "great fighter; he bears a great grudge against all wandering knights, by\n",
       "reason of some wrong that was done him by such a knight in time past.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Then said Sir Calepine: “Go your way to your master, and tell him that a\n",
       "wandering knight craves shelter for a wounded lady, and that he is\n",
       "willing to fight, but craves that Sir Turpin will, of his courtesy,\n",
       "postpone this issue till the day following.” To this request no answer\n",
       "other than had first been delivered was made, and Sir Calepine perforce\n",
       "turned away, not knowing what else he could do. All that night he\n",
       "sheltered the lady under a bush as best he could. The next day he went\n",
       "on his way, hoping to find some more hospitable place, and walking as\n",
       "before by the lady’s side.\n",
       "\n",
       "But he was not suffered to proceed far; for Sir Turpin, filled with\n",
       "hatred and malice, pursued after him and overtook him, and having him at\n",
       "a disadvantage, for he had the charge of the lady on his hands, went\n",
       "near to slaying him. Slain without doubt he had been, but for help that\n",
       "came to him beyond all hope. A savage man, who dwelt in the wood,\n",
       "hearing the lady’s cry, hastened to discover what had befallen. He was\n",
       "as a brute beast, and had never before felt in his breast any touch of\n",
       "pity; but now, seeing the knight so hardly pressed, was moved to help\n",
       "him. Neither armour had he nor arms, being wont to strike with such\n",
       "things as came to his hand, and for protection he had a magic charm,\n",
       "which from his birth had made him proof against all wounds. He took no\n",
       "thought how he could best attack Sir Turpin, but ran at him with great\n",
       "fury. The knight struck him full upon the breast with his spear, but\n",
       "made no wound. And when the wild man’s fury grew greater and greater,\n",
       "and he caught hold of the knight’s shield, and the knight on the other\n",
       "hand perceived that neither spear nor sword availed anything against\n",
       "him, then Sir Turpin left his shield and his spear also and fled. Nor\n",
       "had he then escaped but for the fleetness of his steed, for the savage\n",
       "also was the fastest of runners. So near did he come that Sir Turpin\n",
       "shrieked aloud for fear, a most unbecoming thing for a knight to do;\n",
       "nevertheless, by the speed of his horse he escaped to his castle.\n",
       "\n",
       "The savage man, therefore, seeing his labour of pursuit to be vain,\n",
       "returned to the place where he had left the knight and the lady. Both he\n",
       "found in very evil case, and tended them with all care, staunching the\n",
       "bleeding of their wounds with juices of healing herbs which he found in\n",
       "the woods. Also he took them to a dwelling which he had in the wood hard\n",
       "by, and gave them such entertainment as he could, beds of leaves on\n",
       "which to sleep, and wild fruits of the wood for food, for the savage man\n",
       "never would slay any living creature.\n",
       "\n",
       "But now there befell these lovers a great mishap. Sir Calepine, being\n",
       "now whole of his wounds, was wandering in the wood, when he heard the\n",
       "cry of an infant which a bear was carrying off in his mouth. This indeed\n",
       "he rescued, but in the chase went so far that he wholly lost his way,\n",
       "and could not by any means return to the place where he had left the\n",
       "Lady Serena. Long did she wait for his coming, being in great doubt and\n",
       "trouble as to what had befallen him, and when, after many days, he was\n",
       "still absent, she purposed to leave the abode of the Savage Man. He\n",
       "would not suffer her to go alone, but clad himself in Sir Calepine’s\n",
       "armour—his sword the knight had put in some secret place—and so set\n",
       "forth; nor, indeed, was ever a stranger pair seen in company.\n",
       "\n",
       "They had not journeyed far before, by great good fortune, they met\n",
       "Prince Arthur. To him Serena told all that had befallen her and Sir\n",
       "Calepine, the misdeeds of Sir Turpin, and the wandering away of the\n",
       "knight. And when Prince Arthur had heard her tale, he said: “You I will\n",
       "bestow with a good and wise man, a hermit, who dwells in these parts. My\n",
       "squire also, who has suffered no little damage, I will leave; as for\n",
       "this discourteous knight who calls himself Turpin, I will punish him\n",
       "forthwith.”\n",
       "\n",
       "And this he did in most effective fashion, slaying him and hanging him\n",
       "after by the heels upon a tree, that others might take warning by his\n",
       "punishment.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now shall be told what befell the Lady Serena, and how it came to\n",
       "pass that she and her lover were found one of another. It chanced one\n",
       "day as she walked in the wood with Prince Arthur’s squire that he was\n",
       "set upon by two knaves, and she, doubting to what end the battle might\n",
       "come, fled away on her feet, and, losing her way, could not by any means\n",
       "return to the hermit’s abode. Being wearied out with long wandering, she\n",
       "lay down in the wood to sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now there dwelt in those parts a savage tribe which was wont to live by\n",
       "robbery. They did not till the ground, nor breed cattle, nor deal in\n",
       "merchandise, but they lived by spoiling of their neighbours’ goods. And\n",
       "they had this evil custom also, that they lived on the flesh of men,\n",
       "devouring all strangers whom they might chance to find within their\n",
       "borders. Some of these savages, as they wandered in the forest, chanced\n",
       "to see Serena, as she lay asleep. Great was their joy to see her, not\n",
       "for her beauty, but because she would make, they thought, so goodly a\n",
       "meal. First they debated whether they should wake her or let her sleep.\n",
       "And it seemed to them better that she should sleep her fill. “She will\n",
       "be the better,” they said, “for her sleep.” Also they agreed together\n",
       "that she should be offered in sacrifice to their god. “He,” said they,\n",
       "“shall have her blood, and we, after the sacrifice, will have a goodly\n",
       "feast on her flesh.” This they set about to do, and having built an\n",
       "altar, they stripped her of her ornaments and robes and laid her upon\n",
       "it; and the priest stood ready to slay her with a knife of stone in his\n",
       "hand, when their evil purpose was baulked.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Calepine, by some happy chance, had come to this same grove, which\n",
       "they had fixed for the place of the sacrifice, and for the feast which\n",
       "was to come after. He was still searching for Serena, and having\n",
       "travelled far that day, had laid himself down to sleep. And now, there\n",
       "being a great noise of bagpipes and horns, for with these they\n",
       "celebrated the solemnity, he started up; and, looking through the\n",
       "branches that were about him, saw the altar set, and the woman lying on\n",
       "it, and the priest, stretching out his hand to slay her. Who she was he\n",
       "knew not, but ran to her help, as was a knight’s duty, and the priest he\n",
       "slew, and not a few of the savages that were gathered round, and the\n",
       "rest fled like to doves that fly before a hawk. So did Sir Calepine\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Now must be told what befell Sir Calidore in his quest. For many days he\n",
       "pursued unceasingly the Blatant Beast. Over hills and through valleys,\n",
       "through forests and across plains, he made his way, and wearied not. The\n",
       "monster he suffered not to rest, nor did he rest himself, save only when\n",
       "Nature commanded; for he feared disgrace, if haply should he, for reason\n",
       "of sloth, forego his task, and the monster should escape. Therefore he\n",
       "went from Court to city, and from city to country, and in the country\n",
       "nothing would content him but he must search in every farm. On a day\n",
       "while he thus urged the pursuit, he came on a company of shepherds who\n",
       "were playing on pipes and singing country ballads, the while their\n",
       "flocks fed near them among the broom bushes with their flowers of gold.\n",
       "When he came near to them he inquired of them whether they had chanced\n",
       "to see such a beast as he sought.\n",
       "\n",
       "They answered him: “We have seen none such in this country, nor have we\n",
       "anything that threatens harm to us or to our flocks. And we pray to the\n",
       "good God that He will keep such creatures far from us.” And one of them,\n",
       "perceiving that the knight was hot and weary, offered him drink, and if\n",
       "he chanced to be hungry, something that he might eat. This courteous\n",
       "offer he gladly accepted, and sat him down, well content with such\n",
       "simple fare as suits the dweller in the country. When he had ended his\n",
       "meal he saw a fair damsel who wore a crown of flowers tied with ribbons\n",
       "of silk, being clad in a gown of home-made green which she had worked\n",
       "with her own hands. She sat on a little hillock in the middle of the\n",
       "company, with company of lovely maids about her, and round these again\n",
       "was a ring of shepherds, piping and singing the praises of their queen,\n",
       "for indeed she did shine as a queen in the midst of her subjects. Fair\n",
       "of face she was and of just proportions, and commended her beauty to all\n",
       "beholders by the modesty of her carriage. There was not one in the place\n",
       "but honoured, and not a few sighed for her in love: but she had no\n",
       "liking for anyone.\n",
       "\n",
       "Greatly did Sir Calidore admire both her beauty and her carriage, for\n",
       "they seemed to him to far excel the shepherd’s estate. “Surely,” he said\n",
       "to himself, “this may be a princess who thus disguises her high\n",
       "condition.” And even while he thought the thought in his heart, Love\n",
       "took him unawares. So he sat musing, and, for a while, so taken was his\n",
       "heart with this new thought, forgot the chase.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now the evening was come and it behoved the shepherds to fold their\n",
       "flocks. So there came an aged sire, Melibæus by name, who was commonly\n",
       "reputed to be the father of the fair maiden—Pastorella was her name. So\n",
       "indeed it was believed, but, in very truth, he had found her as an\n",
       "infant lying in an open field, and taking her home, had brought her up\n",
       "as his child, for child of his very own he had none. The old man said,\n",
       "“Night falls, and we must fold the flocks.” Nor was there any want of\n",
       "helpers to the fair Pastorella. Many were eager to manage her sheep, and\n",
       "none more eager than Corydon.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Melibæus, seeing how Sir Calidore sat alone, seeming to have no\n",
       "place of abode, and that night was now near at hand, said to him: “Fair\n",
       "sir, I have but a humble cottage; yet is this a better lodging than the\n",
       "bare field; I pray you to take up your abode with me this night.” To\n",
       "which Sir Calidore gladly agreed, for indeed there was nothing that he\n",
       "more desired.\n",
       "\n",
       "A hearty welcome did the old man and his wife accord to the knight.\n",
       "Shortly after, the fair Pastorella came back from folding her flock, and\n",
       "they all sat down to sup in high content, and had much pleasant talk\n",
       "concerning the shepherd’s life, the delights of which old Melibæus set\n",
       "forth. “Let those who will seek after honour and wealth and the good\n",
       "things of this world: I am content with what I have. My nights I spend\n",
       "in quiet sleep, my days in honest toil. I take good care that the fox\n",
       "shall not harm my lambs; I catch birds in snares, and fishes with hook\n",
       "and net. When I am weary, I rest my limbs under the green tree; when I\n",
       "am thirsty, I drink of the brook. Time was when I was not content with\n",
       "these simple things, but must raise myself above my fellows, and seek\n",
       "fortune elsewhere. So I left my home and betook myself to the King’s\n",
       "Court, and worked for hire. But I perceived that in this life there was\n",
       "vanity and discontent; after ten years, therefore, had passed, I came\n",
       "back to my home and to peace, and I have learnt to love it daily more\n",
       "and more.” While the good man talked, the knight was well content to\n",
       "listen. Much he liked to hear such speech, but more to look at the fair\n",
       "Pastorella.\n",
       "\n",
       "After a while he said to the old man, “Good father, I would gladly rest\n",
       "a while in this peaceful place. The ship of my life has of late been\n",
       "greatly tossed by tempestuous winds and in stormy seas. Let it therefore\n",
       "find haven here, and I meanwhile will meditate what course I shall\n",
       "follow for the time to come. But I would not that my entertainment\n",
       "should be a burden to you. Your simple fare and such lodging as you can\n",
       "give content me well; but for these you should have fair guerdon.” So\n",
       "saying he drew from his pouch a great store of gold, and would have the\n",
       "old man take it. But Melibæus pushed it from him.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I desire it not,” he said; “this is the thing that breeds such mischief\n",
       "in the world. But if you are content to abide here and lead our\n",
       "shepherd’s life, be it so; I am well content.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So Sir Calidore abode in the old man’s house, delighting himself with\n",
       "the daily sight of the fair Pastorella, and bearing her company whenever\n",
       "he could find excuse. Very high courtesy did he show to the maid; but\n",
       "she, having been used to more lowly things, held it in but light esteem.\n",
       "This the knight did not fail to perceive. So he doffed his knightly\n",
       "attire, and clad himself in shepherd’s dress, and laid aside his spear\n",
       "for a shepherd’s crook. One had thought him another Paris when for\n",
       "Œnone’s sake he fed her flocks on the Phrygian Ida. So did the shepherd\n",
       "Calidore go day by day to the fields with Pastorella’s flock. He kept\n",
       "watch against the wolf while the maid sported and played, and at\n",
       "even—such is the might of love—he would essay to help in the milking of\n",
       "the ewes.\n",
       "\n",
       "These things were little to the liking of Corydon, who had long courted\n",
       "the maid. He wore a scowling face and would complain that old service\n",
       "was forgotten, and bore himself in most injurious fashion. Calidore, on\n",
       "the other hand, never abated one jot of his usual courtesy, showing no\n",
       "sign of rancour or offence, but rather seeking, as it seemed, to commend\n",
       "his rival to the good opinion of the maid. So when they danced to the\n",
       "piping of Colin Clout, and the others would have Calidore lead the ring,\n",
       "the knight took Corydon and set him in his place. And when Pastorella\n",
       "took the garland of flowers from her head and set it on Calidore’s, he\n",
       "again put it on the head of Corydon, much to the youth’s content.\n",
       "Another time, when the shepherds had games and contests of skill and\n",
       "strength, the prize being a garland which the fair Pastorella had twined\n",
       "with her own hands, Corydon stepped into the ring and challenged the\n",
       "knight to a bout of wrestling. He was himself well skilled in the art,\n",
       "and being supple and strong sought to put his rival to open shame. But\n",
       "he was much mistaken in his man, for the knight far excelled him both in\n",
       "strength and in skill, and gave him such a fall as well-nigh broke his\n",
       "neck. Nevertheless, when Pastorella bestowed on him the crown, he passed\n",
       "it to Corydon, saying that he in truth deserved it more, and that he had\n",
       "prevailed by fortune rather than by skill. Thus did the knight, so\n",
       "courteous was he and large of heart, win the fair maiden’s favour. But\n",
       "there was nothing which advanced him more than that which is now to be\n",
       "told.\n",
       "\n",
       "On a certain day when these three, to wit, Pastorella and Sir Calidore\n",
       "and the shepherd Corydon, went out into the wood to gather strawberries,\n",
       "a tiger suddenly rushed out from a thicket, and with wide gaping mouth\n",
       "ran at the maid. She, seeing herself alone, for her companions chanced\n",
       "to be divided from her, cried aloud for succour. And when Corydon, who\n",
       "was the nearer of the two, heard the cry, he ran to help her. But when\n",
       "he saw how fierce a beast it was that was attacking her, his courage\n",
       "failed him, and he fled, putting his life before his love. But Calidore,\n",
       "who also had heard the crying, coming not far behind, when he saw the\n",
       "tiger and the maiden held in his claws, ran at the beast with all his\n",
       "strength, and first striking him to the ground with such a blow that the\n",
       "creature could not stand under it, then cut off its head and laid it at\n",
       "the maiden’s feet. Small wonder is it that she gave her love to a knight\n",
       "so courteous and so bold. So for a while they abode in great content,\n",
       "save that Sir Calidore had put out of his mind the quest on which he was\n",
       "bound, concerning which quest he had sworn to the great Queen Gloriana\n",
       "that nothing should hinder him from it.\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "It chanced one day that while Sir Calidore was hunting in the woods—it\n",
       "pleased him more to be hunter than to be shepherd—a company of lawless\n",
       "men who never used the spade or plough, but lived by the spoiling of\n",
       "their neighbours, fell upon the shepherds’ village, and spoiled their\n",
       "houses and drove away their flocks. Many of the men they slew, and many\n",
       "they led away captives. Among these was old Melibæus and the fair\n",
       "Pastorella and also Corydon. These the brigands carried away to an\n",
       "island where they dwelt, a close place, hidden with great woods round\n",
       "about, meaning, when occasion offered, to sell them to merchants who\n",
       "dealt in such wares.\n",
       "\n",
       "When they had remained in ward for a while the captain of the brigands,\n",
       "seeing Pastorella how fair she was, conceived a great love for her, and\n",
       "when she spake him fair, would have had her marry him. This she was\n",
       "ill-content to do, but could not devise any other means to stay his\n",
       "importunities than to feign a sudden sickness. While she was making this\n",
       "pretence there came to the island a company of slave merchants, who,\n",
       "inquiring whether there were any of the wares in which they dealt, were\n",
       "brought to the captain.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Sir,” said the brigands to the captain, “here be the merchants; ’twould\n",
       "be well that all the captives whom we have should be brought out and\n",
       "sold for such a price as may be agreed upon, and the money divided in\n",
       "equal shares.”\n",
       "\n",
       "To this the captain could not but consent. The captives, therefore, were\n",
       "brought forward, Melibæus and Corydon and the others, and the merchants\n",
       "set a price upon them. This being finished, said one of the brigands,\n",
       "“There is yet another captive, a very fair maid, for whom, without\n",
       "doubt, you would pay much money, so beautiful is she to look upon.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay,” cried the captain, “that maid is not for selling. She is my wife,\n",
       "nor has anyone any concern with her. She, too, is now so wasted and worn\n",
       "with sickness that no one would be willing to pay for her a price,\n",
       "however small.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So he took them to the chamber where she abode. A poor place it was,\n",
       "gloomy and dark, and the maiden was wasted and wan. Nevertheless the\n",
       "merchants were astonished at her beauty. “The others,” said their\n",
       "spokesman, “are but common wares. We will buy them, if you will, but on\n",
       "this condition only, that we may buy this maiden also.” And he named for\n",
       "her a price of a thousand pieces of gold.\n",
       "\n",
       "The captain’s wrath was much moved at these words. “My love,” he cried,\n",
       "“shall not be sold. With the others you may do as you will, but to her I\n",
       "hold.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Nay,” said the one who was chief among the brigands, “you do us great\n",
       "wrong. We have our equal share in her, and we demand that she be sold\n",
       "with the rest.”\n",
       "\n",
       "When he heard this, the captain drew his sword from its sheath, and\n",
       "shouted that anyone who should dare lay hands on her should straightway\n",
       "die. On this there followed a great battle. But first they slew the\n",
       "prisoners, lest haply they should turn against the weaker side. Thus did\n",
       "old Melibæus die and with him many others, but Corydon escaped. This\n",
       "being done, the thieves fought among themselves; and soon the captain,\n",
       "who was ever more careful of Pastorella than of his own life, was slain,\n",
       "and she, being wounded with the same stroke by which he was bereft of\n",
       "life, fell upon the ground, being hidden under a pile of dead bodies.\n",
       "The captain being dead, the strife of which he was the beginning and the\n",
       "chief cause soon came to an end. The brigands, searching among the dead,\n",
       "found the maid still lived, though sorely wounded; they gave her,\n",
       "therefore, such care as could be found in so rude a place.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the meanwhile Corydon had made his way to the village where he dwelt,\n",
       "and there he encountered the knight, who, seeing the house in which he\n",
       "dwelt utterly spoiled and void of all inhabitants, was overwhelmed with\n",
       "trouble and fear. To him he told the story of how he, with the rest, had\n",
       "been led into captivity, and how the brigands had fallen out among\n",
       "themselves, and how the captain had fought with the others, and had been\n",
       "slain, and with him Pastorella, for so the shepherd believed.\n",
       "\n",
       "For a while Sir Calidore was wholly mastered by his grief. Yet coming to\n",
       "himself, he considered that Corydon had not seen with his own eyes all\n",
       "that he had told, because he had fled away before the strife had so much\n",
       "as begun; and so hope, which is ever hard to kill in the hearts of men,\n",
       "sprang up within him, and he made a great resolve that he would find her\n",
       "if she yet lived, or avenge her if she had died. He therefore said to\n",
       "Corydon: “Come now, and show me the place where these brigands dwell,”\n",

       "minded to run again into the danger from which he had escaped.\n",
       "Nevertheless Sir Calidore so wrought upon him that he consented to go.\n",
       "\n",
       "The two therefore set out together clad in shepherd’s clothing, and\n",
       "carrying each a shepherd’s crook; but Sir Calidore had donned his\n",
       "armour. After a while they saw on a hill which was not far away some\n",
       "flocks and shepherds tending them, and approached them, hoping to learn\n",
       "something about the matter with which they were concerned. Then they\n",
       "perceived that these flocks were indeed the same as the brigands had\n",
       "driven away, for Corydon knew his own sheep when he saw them, and wept\n",
       "for pity, being in grievous fear because he perceived that they who kept\n",
       "them were none other than the brigands themselves. These, however, were\n",
       "but ill shepherds, for they lay fast asleep. Corydon would have had Sir\n",
       "Calidore slay them as they slept. But the knight hoped that he might\n",
       "gain from them some tidings of her whom he was seeking. So, waking them\n",
       "gently, he gave them courteous greeting. And when the brigands would\n",
       "know who he was, he answered that he and his companion were used to the\n",
       "keeping of cattle and the like, and now, having run away from their\n",
       "masters, sought to find service elsewhere.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Take service then with us,” said the brigands, “for this work is not to\n",
       "our liking.” To this the two agreed, and took charge accordingly.\n",
       "\n",
       "When night fell the brigands took them to the cave where they dwelt.\n",
       "There Sir Calidore learnt many things which he desired to know, and\n",
       "chief of all that Pastorella was yet alive. At midnight, when all were\n",
       "sleeping sound, Sir Calidore, fully armed, for he had found a sword,\n",
       "though but of the meanest sort, went to the cave wherein dwelt the new\n",
       "captain of the band. It was indeed barred, but the knight soon broke\n",
       "down the bars, and when the captain, roused by the noise, came running\n",
       "to the entrance, slew him. Pastorella, being within, was at the first\n",
       "not a little alarmed at this new intruder, yet was greatly comforted to\n",
       "see again her own lover, and he also was overcome with joy, and catching\n",
       "her in his arms, kissed her most tenderly. Meanwhile the thieves had\n",
       "gathered together, perceiving that some new danger threatened them. But\n",
       "Sir Calidore, standing in the opening, slew them as they approached. In\n",
       "the end he utterly vanquished the whole company, and spoiled their\n",
       "goods. As for the sheep, he gave them as a gift to Corydon. The fair\n",
       "Pastorella he bestowed in the house of a certain Sir Bellamour and the\n",
       "lady Claribell his wife.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now must be told the true name and lineage of this same maiden\n",
       "Pastorella. Sir Bellamour in former time had served a very great lord of\n",
       "those parts who had one daughter, Claribell by name. This same lord had\n",
       "promised her in marriage to the lord of Pictland, which was the\n",
       "neighbouring dominion, thinking that the two domains might thus be\n",
       "conveniently joined together. Claribell meanwhile loved Sir Bellamour,\n",
       "who was a very gallant knight. So fondly did she love him that she\n",
       "consented to a secret wedlock, having good hopes that her father might\n",
       "relent. But when he continued to be hard of heart, she having borne a\n",
       "maiden babe, was constrained to commit the child to a woman who waited\n",
       "upon her. This same woman, taking the babe into the field, laid it under\n",
       "a bush, and having hidden herself hard by, waited to see what should\n",
       "happen, for she trusted that someone, hearing its cry, would take it up.\n",
       "But first she noted that it had on its breast a little spot of purple\n",
       "colour, like to a rosebud. After a while the shepherd Melibæus passing\n",
       "by, heard the voice of the babe, and taking it from its place, carried\n",
       "it home to his wife, who, being herself childless, gladly took it in\n",
       "charge, and reared it for her own. No long time after the Lady\n",
       "Claribell’s father died and left to her all that he had, and she having\n",
       "now no cause why she should conceal her marriage, took Sir Bellamour\n",
       "openly for her husband, and had lived with him in great content until\n",
       "the coming of Sir Calidore into those parts.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now Sir Calidore bethought him of his quest, that he must not delay\n",
       "its accomplishment any longer, and, indeed, he feared lest he should\n",
       "suffer in fame because he had put it aside in thinking of other things.\n",
       "Now, therefore, he departed, leaving Pastorella in the charge of the\n",
       "Lady Claribell, the same undertaking this care most willingly, for the\n",
       "maid was fair and gracious, and was altogether one to be loved. Sir\n",
       "Bellamour also, having a friendship for Sir Calidore, with whom he had\n",
       "served the Queen Gloriana in time past, was glad to help him in this\n",
       "fashion.\n",
       "\n",
       "It chanced on a day that the Lady Claribell’s waiting woman, Melissa by\n",
       "name, being the same that in time past had served her in the matter of\n",
       "the new-born babe, was doing service to the fair Pastorella in the\n",
       "matter of her attire. Being so engaged, she spied the mark on her bosom\n",
       "and said to herself, “Surely this is the very mark of a rosebud that I\n",
       "saw on the Lady Claribell’s maiden babe, and the years of her age, as\n",
       "far as may be guessed, agree thereto.” Having this in her mind, she ran\n",
       "straightway to the lady, her mistress, and unfolded the whole matter,\n",
       "how she had noted the mark, and how the old shepherd had taken the babe\n",
       "from the ground. That this shepherd and his wife had been as father and\n",
       "mother to the maiden was of common knowledge. Nor did the Lady Claribell\n",
       "delay to search out the matter with her own eyes, and, being satisfied\n",
       "that this was indeed her very child, took her to herself with great joy,\n",
       "as did also her husband, Sir Bellamour.\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile Sir Calidore pursued the Blatant Beast, and at the last\n",
       "overtook him. The monster, having spoiled all the other places in the\n",
       "realm, was wasting the church, robbing the chancel and fouling the\n",
       "altar, and casting down all the goodly ornaments. When he saw the knight\n",
       "he fled, knowing that he was in peril, yet could he not escape. In a\n",
       "narrow place Sir Calidore overtook him and compelled him to turn. Sore\n",
       "was the conflict between these two, for the beast ran at the knight with\n",
       "open mouth, set with a double range of iron teeth, between which were a\n",
       "thousand tongues giving out dreadful cries as of all manner of beasts,\n",
       "tongues of serpents also spitting out poison, and of all other venomous\n",
       "things that are upon the earth. Not one whit dismayed, the knight ran in\n",
       "upon him, and when the monster lifted himself up on his hind legs, and\n",
       "would have rent him with his claws, he threw his shield between and held\n",
       "him down. Vainly did the beast rage and strive to lift himself from the\n",
       "ground; the more he strove, the more hardly and heavily did the knight\n",
       "press upon him. At the last, when the creature’s strength now failed\n",
       "him, the knight put a great muzzle of iron with many links in his mouth,\n",
       "so that he should no more send forth those evil voices. And to the\n",
       "muzzle he fastened a long chain with which he led him, he following as a\n",
       "dog, so utterly was he subdued. Through all Fairyland he led him, the\n",
       "people thronging out of their towns to see him, and much admiring the\n",
       "knight who, by his great strength and valour, had subdued so foul and\n",
       "fierce a creature.\n",
       "\n",
       "’Tis true that in after days, whether by some evil chance or by the\n",
       "folly of those who had charge of the monster, these bonds were broken;\n",
       "for even now the creature wanders about the world doing great harm to\n",
       "all estates of men. For it must be known that his name is Slander.\n",
       "\n",
       "But in the good times of old it was not so. So did Sir Calidore fulfil\n",
       "his quest. And afterwards he lived in all happiness, as became so brave\n",
       "and loyal a knight, with his wedded wife, the fair Pastorella.\n",
